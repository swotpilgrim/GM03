# Chapter 11: Planning the Infiltration

Ruth Morrison had organized parent-teacher conferences, PTA meetings, school fundraisers. She knew how to plan operations, coordinate people, anticipate problems.

This was different. This was planning a felony.

The morning meeting convened in her motel room at eight. Dale arrived first, looking like he hadn't slept. Shauna came with her medical kit and coffee. Levon brought his surveillance photos. Kimmy sat cross-legged on the floor with her sketchbook.

Ruth stood by the window, spiral notebook in hand, trying to ignore the knot in her stomach.

"We need to talk about our next move," she said.

Dale spoke up immediately. "We contact authorities. Right now. We know there's a bunker. We know people are being held."

"Do we?" Ruth asked. "We have circumstantial evidence."

"My historical research. Shauna's proof of drugging. Levon's photos. That's substantial."

"It's circumstantial," Levon said flatly. "No direct proof anyone's imprisoned. Just food deliveries. Defense lawyer would tear that apart."

Shauna nodded. "If we bring authorities now, before definitive proof, Elijah could dispose of evidence. He's done it before."

"So we risk breaking in instead?" Dale's voice was strained. "That's illegal. Breaking and entering. If we're caught—"

"Seven people are imprisoned," Ruth interrupted. Her teacher voice. Firm but not harsh. "Possibly more. We know Elijah has killed before. We know he's building toward something catastrophic. We can't wait for authorities who might not act quickly enough."

Dale paced. "This is dangerous. If something goes wrong—"

"Then we improvise," Levon said.

Ruth watched Dale struggle. He was afraid. She was terrified. But fear couldn't paralyze them.

"We infiltrate the bunker tomorrow night during the evening service. Gather definitive evidence—photographs, testimonies, medical evaluations. Then we take everything to state authorities with a case they can't ignore."

Shauna set down her coffee. "I agree. We need visual proof of imprisonment. Photos of people being held against their will. My medical documentation of drugging. Testimony from the victims themselves."

Levon spread his surveillance photos on the bed. "Tomorrow night, seven o'clock. Evening service starts. Elijah preaches for two to three hours. That's our window."

Dale sat heavily on the chair. "Explain the plan."

Levon pulled out his hand-drawn infiltration map. Security positions, sight lines, entry and exit routes marked precisely.

"Elijah starts preaching at seven. By seven-fifteen, everyone's focused on the stage. I pick the lock on the prayer tent—thirty seconds. Dale and Shauna come with me. We descend into the bunker."

"What about me?" Kimmy asked quietly.

"You and Ruth stay topside," Levon said. "Attend the service. Act normal. If something goes wrong, you create a distraction. Drop your purse, cause a scene, anything to pull attention away from the prayer tent."

Ruth made notes. "Communications?"

"Walkie-talkies. I borrowed a set from the truck stop on the highway. Two-mile range, should work even underground if it's not too deep."

"What do we document?" Shauna asked.

"Everything," Levon said. "How many people imprisoned. Their condition. Physical evidence of confinement. You take photos, Shauna evaluates medically, Dale talks to them, gets testimony."

"Timeline?" Ruth pressed.

"Ninety minutes maximum. In at seven-thirty, out by nine. Elijah's still preaching, congregation's still entranced. We slip back into the service, blend with the crowd, leave when it ends."

Dale rubbed his face. "And if we're caught?"

Levon's expression hardened. "If we're caught, I go back to prison. Parole violation, breaking and entering, conspiracy to commit felony. Five years minimum, probably more."

"What about the rest of us?" Kimmy whispered.

"Accessories to felony. As minors you might get probation. Adults..." Levon looked at Ruth and Shauna. "Could be jail time. Could be fines and probation. Depends on the prosecutor."

Silence filled the room. Ruth felt the weight of it. She was asking these people to commit crimes. To risk their freedom. For seven strangers they'd never met.

But then she thought about Sarah Dalton. Sixteen years old, watching her parents defend the man who'd taken her brother. Powerless. Knowing something was wrong but unable to act.

They weren't powerless.

"I'm in," Ruth said. "Seven people's lives are worth the risk."

Shauna nodded. "I'm in."

Levon just said, "Obviously."

They all looked at Dale.

He sat there, hands trembling slightly, face pale. Ruth saw the war happening inside him—theology versus action, safety versus moral obligation.

"Dale," she said gently. "If you want to stay topside with Kimmy and me, that's okay. We need people up here too."

"No." Dale stood. "No, I'm going. Those people need to know someone's coming for them. They need hope. I can give them that."

Kimmy raised her hand like she was in class. "I'll be the distraction if you need it. I can scream or faint or anything."

Ruth felt a surge of affection for this broken girl who'd spent her life invisible, now volunteering to be seen.

"Thank you, Kimmy."

They spent two hours refining the plan. Levon taught lockpicking techniques. Shauna listed medical supplies. Dale organized interview questions for traumatized prisoners.

Ruth took notes on everything. Timeline, checklist, contingencies.

By eleven, they had it mapped. Tomorrow night. Infiltrate the bunker. Gather evidence. Save seven people.

Simple. Terrifying.

"Get some rest," Ruth said. "Meet back here at six tomorrow evening. We'll go to the service together."

They dispersed. Kimmy lingered.

"Mrs. Morrison? Are we really going to save them?"

Ruth looked at this sixteen-year-old who'd survived things Ruth couldn't imagine, who still had enough hope to ask that question.

"Yes," Ruth said. "We really are."

---

Evening came too fast and too slow. Ruth tried to nap but couldn't sleep.

At five o'clock, there was a knock. All four of them stood there.

"Dinner," Levon said. "Last normal evening before we commit multiple felonies."

Ruth laughed despite her fear. "The diner?"

They walked together through early evening heat. The five of them crowded into a corner booth. Kimmy between Ruth and Dale. Shauna and Levon across.

The waitress took their orders. Burgers, fries, pie. Comfort food before danger.

While they waited, Levon pulled out a deck of cards. "Poker?"

"Really?" Shauna asked.

"Keeps the nerves steady."

They played terrible poker, laughing at blown hands and obvious tells. Kimmy won three hands in a row, her face lighting up with each victory.

The food arrived. They ate slowly, savoring normalcy.

Dale told a story about seminary—how he'd accidentally locked himself in a supply closet during a theology exam and had to be rescued by the janitor. Ruth shared her most disastrous field trip—the zoo visit where two kids got lost in the reptile house and she'd found them trying to "rescue" a python.

Shauna talked about her first week as a nurse. "I fainted during a surgery. Full collapse. Had to be carried out. My supervisor said maybe I wasn't cut out for ER work. I went back the next day and stayed for eight years."

Levon was quiet at first. Then Kimmy asked about his childhood.

He hesitated. Ruth thought he'd deflect. But he said, "Foster care. Twelve different families from age six to eighteen. None of them wanted me long-term. I was just a check from the state."

"I'm sorry," Kimmy said softly.

"Made me who I am. Taught me to rely on myself. Not all bad." Levon shuffled the cards. "But I never had people I could count on. Not really. Not like this."

Ruth felt something catch in her chest. "We count on each other now."

"Yeah," Levon said. "Yeah, we do."

The jukebox in the corner started playing—Dolly Parton, "9 to 5." Kimmy hummed along, drawing in her sketchbook.

Ruth looked at the sketch. All five of them, sitting in this booth. But Kimmy had drawn them larger, heroic. Ruth with her notebook held like a shield. Dale with his briefcase glowing. Shauna with medical supplies strapped like armor. Levon with lockpicks like weapons. And Kimmy herself, small but standing firm.

"That's beautiful," Ruth said.

"It's us," Kimmy said simply. "How I see us."

As heroes. Not five strangers trapped in a small town. As people who chose to act when everyone else looked away.

Ruth's throat tightened.

They finished eating. Levon paid the check. They walked back through gathering dusk.

At the motel, Ruth unlocked her room. The equipment was spread across the bed.

Flashlights with red filters. Camera with fresh film. Levon's lockpick set. Two walkie-talkies. Shauna's medical kit. Dale's notebook.

Ruth's spiral notebook with the plan in careful teacher handwriting.

They stood looking at it. The tools of their crime.

"Last chance to back out," Levon said. "No judgment. This is serious risk."

No one moved.

"Okay then." Levon checked his watch. "Six-thirty. Service starts at seven. We walk over at quarter to, blend with the crowd, wait for the right moment."

Ruth distributed equipment. Flashlights to each person. Walkie-talkies to Levon and Ruth. Camera to Shauna. Notebook to Dale. Lockpicks to Levon.

"Everyone clear on roles?" Ruth asked.

Nods all around.

"Contingencies?"

"If spotted, we claim we got lost looking for the bathroom," Shauna said.

"If confronted, we separate and reconvene at the truck stop on the highway," Levon added.

"If caught by Elijah directly..." Dale trailed off.

"We tell the truth," Ruth finished. "We know he's holding people prisoner. We're rescuing them. Let him explain to authorities why he doesn't want us calling for help."

It was thin. But it was something.

Ruth looked at each of them. Dale, pale but determined. Shauna, clinical and focused. Levon, calm and ready. Kimmy, scared but committed.

Five strangers who'd become something more.

"Whatever happens tomorrow," Ruth said, "I'm proud to be doing this with you."

Dale smiled. "Same."

Shauna: "Agreed."

Levon: "Let's save some people."

Kimmy just hugged Ruth, then each of the others. When she got to Levon, he awkwardly patted her shoulder, and Ruth saw the tough ex-con's eyes were damp.

They left Ruth's room. Tomorrow night. Infiltrate the bunker. Gather evidence. Change everything.

Ruth sat alone with her notes, the equipment, the weight of responsibility.

She'd spent twenty years teaching teenagers, protecting them, guiding them toward better futures. Now she was leading four people into criminal activity to save seven others.

But if she didn't, who would?

Ruth thought about her ex-husband. How he'd called her boring, predictable, too controlled. How he'd wanted adventure and left her for someone more exciting.

Tomorrow night, she'd be breaking into an underground bunker to rescue cult prisoners from a serial killer.

Not boring. Not predictable.

And definitely not controlled.

Ruth smiled grimly, closed her notebook, and tried to get some sleep before they committed multiple felonies for the greater good.
