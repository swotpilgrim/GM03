# Chapter 26: Elijah's Journal

The knock came at ten PM. Dale opened his motel room door to find Detective Alvarez holding a leather-bound journal.

"Thought you might want to see this," Alvarez said. "Unofficially."

Dale recognized it—Elijah's personal journal. Evidence, technically.

"Why?"

"Because you understand this better than I do. You challenged him on scripture. You saw what he was becoming." Alvarez handed over the journal. "Read it tonight. Return it tomorrow morning."

Dale took the journal. Heavy, worn, pages thick with two years of entries.

"Thank you."

Alvarez nodded and left.

Dale closed the door, set the journal on the small desk, made coffee from the room's machine, and sat down to read.

---

**YEAR ONE**

The early entries were dated two years ago, starting when Elijah had arrived in Louisiana for a small-town revival. The handwriting was neat, the theology orthodox, the tone hopeful.

*March 12—Arrived in Baton Rouge. The congregation is small but eager. I preached on Romans 12 tonight. "Present your bodies as a living sacrifice." The Spirit moved through that tent. People wept. I felt God's presence so strongly.*

*March 25—Visited Sister Thompson in the hospital. Pancreatic cancer, stage four. Prayed with her. Laid hands on her. Felt such warmth, such certainty that God was working. She smiled. Said she felt peace.*

*April 2—Sister Thompson died last night. The family thanked me for bringing her comfort. But I keep wondering—why didn't God heal her? I prayed with absolute faith. She deserved healing. Why take her?*

Dale read the progression. A man of faith encountering the oldest question: why does God allow suffering? Elijah wrestled honestly, searching scripture.

Then came the first vision.

*April 18—I saw something tonight. After the service, alone in the tent. A figure. Tall, dressed in white, standing at the tent's edge. I called out—it didn't respond. Just stood there. Then gone. Probably exhaustion.*

*April 20—The figure again. I approached it this time. Tall—seven feet maybe—and the white wasn't clothing, just... white. Like light. I said "Are you an angel?" It didn't speak, but I felt approval. Then it vanished.*

*April 25—It speaks. Not words exactly, but I understand it. It tells me I'm chosen for special work. That God has a plan for me. That I will deliver souls to paradise. I asked what souls. It showed me a vision—hundreds of people ascending, leaving their bodies, entering light. Beautiful. Terrifying. I woke up weeping.*

Dale set down the journal, made more coffee, kept reading.

The visions intensified. Elijah described the figure appearing regularly, always at the tent's edges or in his trailer late at night. Always tall, always white, never quite visible clearly. And it gave instructions.

*June 3—IT says (I call it IT because "he" doesn't feel right) I must gather specific souls. Not random people but chosen ones—those who are ready to ascend early. IT will help me identify them. IT will give me signs.*

*June 10—The signs are subtle. A feeling when certain people attend services. Like IT points them out to me. I invited three for special prayer. They came willingly. IT was pleased.*

Dale noticed the shift. "God" appeared less frequently. "IT" appeared more. The theology warped—ascension wasn't metaphorical anymore but literal, physical, imminent.

By year one's end, Elijah had moved twice—Louisiana to Arkansas—because local authorities were "interfering with God's work."

**YEAR TWO**

The handwriting degraded slightly. Entries became longer, more obsessive.

*January 14—Oklahoma now. Larger congregation. IT says this is where I build toward the great ascension. Not just a few souls but many. Hundreds. A sacrifice that will trigger the end times.*

*January 30—I've been reading Revelation constantly. IT helps me understand the symbolism. The 144,000 sealed servants. The first resurrection. IT says I'm the instrument. My name—Elijah—is prophetic. Like Elijah of old who ascended in a chariot of fire.*

*February 18—Acquired the drug from a sympathetic pharmacist. IT suggested it. Not to harm but to prepare. The believers need to be open, receptive, free from doubt. The benzodiazepines will help them hear IT as I do.*

Dale's hands tightened on the journal. This was where true crime began—acquiring sedatives, planning pharmaceutical manipulation. All justified through twisted theology.

*March 5—The bunker is ready. IT showed me the location. Old fallout shelter beneath the fairgrounds. Perfect for preparation. I'll bring the chosen ones there for fasting and prayer. IT will visit them too. They'll see what I see.*

The entries became darker. Doubt crept in, then was suppressed.

*April 12—Why do IT's eyes look wrong? I finally saw them tonight, through the shadows. Too many. Or too few. Not arranged like human eyes. But IT assures me divine beings appear strange to mortal perception. I trust IT.*

*April 29—A small voice in my head asks: what if IT isn't God? What if I'm sick? But that's Satan's whisper. Doubt is sin. I will not doubt.*

*May 15—The first souls ascended last night. Two people, in the bunker, drank the full preparation. IT said they would transform and return. They didn't. They died. I found them this morning. Did I... did I kill them? No. NO. IT says their bodies died but their souls ascended. This is the process. I must have faith.*

Dale felt sick reading it. Elijah had killed two people and rationalized it through his delusion. The journal documented it clearly—accidental death through poisoning, reinterpreted as successful ascension.

That's when Elijah had fled Oklahoma. Moved to Arkansas. Started again.

The pattern repeated. Revival services. Drugging. Isolation of vulnerable believers. Moving before investigations got serious.

Then came Texas.

**FINAL MONTHS**

*June 20—Texas. Crossroads town. IT says this is the culmination. The final harvest. I'm ready now. I understand the plan fully.*

*July 3—Twenty souls in preparation. The final service will bring hundreds more. IT promises when enough ascend simultaneously, the veil will tear. The end will begin. I'll be remembered as God's greatest prophet.*

But cracks appeared.

*July 18—IT doesn't promise salvation anymore. When I ask about paradise, IT just says "ending." I asked what that means. IT smiled. (Do beings of light smile? The smile was wrong.) I'm afraid to ask again.*

*July 25—I saw IT's true form for just a moment. Not tall divine being but something else. Something that doesn't fit right in the air, like the space around IT bends wrong. I looked away fast. IT noticed. Now IT watches me constantly. I can't escape IT even when I'm alone.*

Then the final week. Entries became frantic.

*August 2—I'm going to do it. The final service. IT demands it. But part of me knows—this isn't God's plan. This is something else. Something that feeds on death. Why didn't I see it before? Why did I believe?*

*August 3—They're questioning me. The strangers from the broken bus. The seminary boy knows scripture, challenges me. What if he's right? What if I'm just insane? What if there's no IT at all, just my broken brain?*

Then the final entry. Written hours before the service. The handwriting was nearly illegible, pressed so hard the pen tore the paper in places.

Dale read it slowly, each word a revelation of horror.

*August 4, 4 PM—IT showed me what comes after. I demanded to know. IT finally revealed truth.

There is no paradise. No ascension. No divine plan.

IT feeds. That's all. IT finds believers—people with enough faith to follow voices—and twists them toward death. IT consumes the belief itself, the certainty, the willingness to die for meaning. And when they die, when their followers die, IT feeds on that too. The ending. The cessation. That's what IT wants.

I asked what IT is. IT said: patient. Older than your God. Older than any god. Present at every mass death where belief was involved. Every cult, every crusade, every holy war. IT whispers. IT suggests. It finds the faithful and makes them instruments.

I asked how many IT has used before me. IT laughed. The sound wasn't sound. Just wrongness in my ears.

Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands across human history? How many Jonesowns? How many Heaven's Gates? How many crusades and witch hunts and holy purges? How many started with a true believer hearing a voice they mistook for God?

I see IT now. Fully. No more shadows. It's in my trailer. Watching me write. Tall but not shaped like tall. Present but not visible right. Eyes that aren't arranged like eyes should be. Patient malevolence wearing white like a mockery of angels.

IT doesn't care that I know now. IT says I'll proceed anyway. That I'm too committed. That my followers are ready and I can't stop it without destroying everything I've built. IT thinks I'll choose to believe the lie rather than face being a monster.

But I won't. I can't. Not anymore. Four hundred people. Twenty already imprisoned. How many more would I have killed?

I'm going to run. Tonight, after the service, I'll run. Not to escape IT—IT will follow—but to get away from the people. To make sure I can't hurt anyone else.

IT's still watching. Still patient. IT will find someone else. IT always does.

God forgive me. If there's a real God beyond IT, beyond my delusions, please forgive me.

I was so certain. I heard a voice and assumed divinity. I saw visions and assumed holiness. I felt chosen and assumed truth.

But certainty isn't righteousness. Visions aren't verification. And feeling chosen doesn't mean being right.

I don't know if IT is real or if I'm insane. I don't know if something external spoke to me or if my brain fractured and created a monster to explain my desires.

But I know the result is the same: death.

And I won't deliver it.

Not anymore.

IT's reaching for me. Time to run—*

The entry ended there. Unfinished.

Elijah had run. Had crashed. Had died fleeing or fighting something invisible.

Dale closed the journal.

Dawn light filtered through the motel room window. He hadn't noticed time passing. Six hours reading the descent of a man from faith to madness to terror.

Or the exploitation of a man by something ancient and patient.

Dale didn't know which. Couldn't know.

But he knew tragedy when he saw it.

Elijah Caine had wanted to serve God and had ended up serving death. Whether the voice was internal or external, the result was hundreds nearly murdered.

And somewhere, maybe, something patient was whispering to someone new.

Dale said a prayer. Not for certainty or answers. Just for mercy. For Elijah's tortured soul, for the survivors healing, for anyone else hearing voices and mistaking them for divinity.

Then he returned the journal to Alvarez.

Some knowledge wasn't meant to be kept.

Only remembered.

And mourned.
