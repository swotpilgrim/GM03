# Chapter 13: Narrow Escape

Dale's hands wouldn't stop shaking.

They'd escaped the bunker. Made it back to the motel. Spread the evidence across Ruth's bed—documents, photos, stolen papers.

But Dale couldn't stop seeing those twenty faces. Peaceful. Sleeping. Unaware that in four days, Elijah planned to poison them along with 124 others.

"Dale," Ruth said gently. "Sit down."

He sat on the edge of the bed, clutching one of the notebooks from Elijah's desk. Leather-bound, worn.

He opened it properly for the first time.

Journal. Personal journal.

Elijah's spidery handwriting covered every page. Dates going back months. Dale's theological training kicked in automatically, scanning for patterns, analyzing content.

The first entry was from February.

*God spoke to me again tonight. He showed me the tribulation. Flames consuming the earth. Seven seals breaking. Four horsemen riding. The faithful few ascending while the damned burn. He told me I must prepare the way. Gather the 144,000. Deliver them before the end comes.*

Dale flipped forward. March entries.

*The voices are constant now. God's instructions. Build the sanctuary. Prepare the vessels. Purify them with sacred medicine. They must be ready. The clock is ticking. The world doesn't know how close we are to the end.*

More pages. April.

*Seven souls prepared now. Sleeping in the sanctuary, waiting. More will come. God sends them to me—lost, broken, perfect for purification. I am merely His instrument. The burden is heavy but I cannot fail Him.*

Dale's stomach turned. "Oh god."

"What?" Shauna asked.

"Elijah's journal. He's not a con man. He's genuinely insane. He believes God is commanding him to deliver 144 souls before the apocalypse."

Ruth crossed to read over his shoulder. Her face went pale.

Dale flipped to recent entries. Last week.

*Twenty vessels prepared. The number grows. Four days until the Final Ascension. God promised me—if I deliver them, the tribulation begins. The world will end and the faithful will ascend to glory. My life's work will be complete. I will have fulfilled His divine command.*

"He thinks if he kills 144 people, the apocalypse will actually happen," Dale said. "Not metaphorically. Literally. He believes God will end the world and rapture the faithful if he delivers these souls."

Levon read another entry. "Listen to this: 'The sheriff asked questions today about missing people. I told him they ascended. He believed me. God protects His work. The authorities cannot stop what He has commanded.'"

"That's why the sheriff dismissed reports," Ruth said. "Elijah convinced him people were leaving voluntarily, finding Jesus. And the sheriff wanted to believe him."

Dale kept reading. Entry after entry documenting visions, conversations with "God," detailed instructions for the Final Ascension ceremony. Elijah's handwriting grew more erratic in recent entries—fevered, desperate.

*Three days now. The voices are overwhelming. HE is urgent. The time is NOW. I must not falter. 144 souls. The communion wine is prepared. The dosage calculated. The faithful are ready. Lord, give me strength to complete Your work.*

Tomorrow's date. Written two days ago.

Dale felt cold. "He's accelerating. This entry from two days ago says 'three days now.' He's counting down."

"Four days," Shauna said. "The countdown calendar in the bunker said four days. That was tonight. So now it's three days until the Final Ascension."

"Sunday," Ruth said quietly. "Three days from now is Sunday. Sunday evening service."

Dale did the math. Today was Thursday night, technically Friday morning now. Three days meant Sunday. The biggest service of the week. The one where every congregation member attended.

"He'll have maximum attendance Sunday night," Dale said. "Maybe two hundred people. He's planning to poison everyone who attends."

Kimmy spoke up from the corner where she'd been sketching. "Can't we just warn people? Tell them not to go?"

"They won't believe us," Levon said. "They're indoctrinated. Drugged. Even if we told them Elijah was planning to poison them, they'd think we were trying to stop divine will."

"Then we get authorities to stop him," Ruth said. She stood, grabbed her purse. "State police. FBI. Someone with power to raid that bunker and arrest Elijah before Sunday."

She looked at the clock on the nightstand. 12:47 AM.

"I'm calling now. There's a payphone at the truck stop."

"I'll go with you," Shauna said.

They left. Dale stayed with Levon and Kimmy, continuing to read Elijah's journal. Each entry was more disturbing than the last. Genuine religious delusion. Elijah truly believed he was God's instrument, that murdering 144 people would trigger the biblical apocalypse.

"He's not evil," Dale said quietly. "He's sick. Schizophrenic, maybe. Delusional. He hears voices and thinks they're God."

"Does that matter?" Levon asked. "Sick or evil, he's still planning to kill people."

"It matters because you can't reason with genuine delusion. He's doing this because he believes God commanded him. That makes him more dangerous. He'll die for this belief. And take everyone with him."

They waited. Twenty minutes. Thirty.

Ruth and Shauna returned at 1:30 AM. Ruth's face was grim.

"Well?" Dale asked.

"I called state police emergency line. Explained everything—imprisoned people, planned mass suicide, four days until it happens. The operator was skeptical. Said it sounded like a family dispute or religious disagreement. But she took the report. Said they'd investigate."

"That's good," Kimmy said hopefully.

"She said they'd investigate during business hours. Monday earliest."

Dale's heart sank. "Monday? Elijah's planning this for Sunday night. Monday's too late."

"I explained that. She said without direct evidence of immediate harm, they couldn't justify a raid on a religious gathering. Constitutional issues. First Amendment protections."

"We have photos," Shauna said. "Twenty people imprisoned and sedated."

"We have photos we took during an illegal break-in. The operator pointed out that any evidence we gathered is inadmissible. Fruit of the poisonous tree. We committed felony breaking and entering."

Levon swore softly.

Ruth sat heavily. "She said if we had a credible witness—someone from inside Elijah's organization willing to testify—they could move faster. Or if we had physical evidence obtained legally. But photos from a burglary won't hold up."

"So they're not coming," Dale said.

"Not in time."

Silence filled the room. Outside, night was fading toward dawn. Friday morning. Two and a half days until Sunday's evening service.

Two and a half days until Elijah poisoned two hundred people.

"We call FBI," Shauna said. "Cult activity falls under their jurisdiction."

Ruth nodded. "I'll try at eight AM when offices open. But they'll have the same problems—inadmissible evidence, constitutional concerns, timeline too tight for bureaucratic approval."

Dale felt despair settling like a weight. They had everything they needed—proof of imprisonment, proof of planned mass suicide, proof of pharmaceutical manipulation. But none of it obtained legally. And no authority willing to act fast enough.

"So what do we do?" Kimmy asked.

Levon organized the photos and documents. "We do it ourselves."

"Do what ourselves?" Dale asked.

"Free the twenty people from the bunker. Get them to safety. Destroy Elijah's poison supply. Disrupt the Final Ascension before it happens."

"That's vigilante justice," Ruth said.

"That's saving lives." Levon met her eyes. "Authorities aren't coming. We're all those people have."

Dale thought about the journal entries. Elijah's absolute certainty that God had commanded this. The countdown calendar written in red. Twenty people sedated and waiting.

Sunday night. Communion service. Poison in the wine. Two hundred people drinking death while Elijah preached about ascension.

"How do we free twenty sedated people?" Shauna asked. "We don't have medical transport. We can't move them without waking them, and if they wake, they might fight us—they're indoctrinated to trust Elijah, not us."

"Then we destroy the poison supply," Levon said. "Find wherever he's storing the arsenic-laced communion wine. Pour it out. He can't poison people if he doesn't have poison."

"He'll just make more," Dale said. "His supply receipts showed he bought enough arsenic to kill hundreds. He'll prepare new wine."

"Then we expose him publicly," Ruth said. "Get the congregation members who aren't completely indoctrinated—like Sarah Dalton—to help us warn others. Create enough doubt that people refuse to attend Sunday service."

"Most won't listen," Levon said. "They're drugged and psychologically controlled."

"But some might," Ruth insisted. "We saved ourselves by refusing to drink the communion wine. We can save others the same way."

They sat in the motel room as dawn light crept through the curtains. Five strangers who'd become a team, now planning how to stop a mass suicide with no official help.

Dale re-read Elijah's journal. The fevered handwriting. The absolute conviction. The countdown.

*God promised me—if I deliver them, the tribulation begins.*

Elijah thought he was saving people. Delivering them to heaven before the world ended. In his delusional mind, poisoning 144 souls was an act of mercy.

That made him unstoppable.

Except they had to stop him anyway.

"We have two and a half days," Ruth said. "We need a plan. Multiple approaches. Free the imprisoned if possible. Destroy poison supply. Warn anyone who'll listen. And have a backup plan for Sunday night if everything else fails."

"What kind of backup plan?" Kimmy asked.

Ruth's expression was grim. "We physically stop the communion service. Knock over the wine. Create chaos. Get people to evacuate before they can drink."

"Elijah won't let us," Levon said. "He's got his inner circle. They'll defend him."

"Then we make it impossible for him to proceed." Ruth pulled out her spiral notebook. "We plan this like a military operation. Every contingency. Every risk. Because those twenty people in the bunker and two hundred people planning to attend Sunday service are counting on us."

Dale looked at Elijah's journal. At the photos of sedated prisoners. At the suicide protocol with its meticulous dosage calculations.

In seminary, he'd learned that faith moved mountains. That believing in something greater than yourself gave you strength to do impossible things.

Elijah had faith. Twisted, delusional faith. But absolute conviction that God had commanded this.

Could they match that? Five frightened people with stolen evidence and no official help?

Dale thought about Sarah Dalton, watching helplessly as her brother vanished. About Linda at the diner, smiling her drugged smile, convinced she was healed. About twenty people sleeping in a bunker, unaware they'd been chosen for sacrifice.

"Yes," Dale said aloud. "We can do this."

Ruth looked up. "What?"

"Stop him. Save them. We can do this." Dale stood, tucking Elijah's journal into his briefcase. "We have truth on our side. That has to count for something."

Levon smiled grimly. "Truth and lockpicks."

Shauna: "Truth and medical knowledge."

Kimmy: "Truth and really good distractions."

Ruth: "Truth and one hell of a plan."

Outside, Friday morning arrived. Two and a half days until Sunday's Final Ascension.

Two and a half days to save 144 lives.

They got to work.
