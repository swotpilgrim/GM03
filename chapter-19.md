# Chapter 19: The Spell Breaks

Shauna had been edging through the crowd when Dale's voice cut through the chaos. She'd positioned herself near the stage's right side, close to where the bunker prisoners stood in their white robes.

The moment had arrived.

"—compare me to murderers and madmen," Elijah said, voice cold with rage.

Dale, who got panic attacks before public speaking, stood his ground and didn't back down.

Shauna made her decision in a heartbeat.

She pushed forward through the mass of bodies, her medical bag clutched tight. People were shouting—some defending Elijah, some questioning, the unified congregation fracturing into individuals. Shauna used her elbows, her compact frame ducking under raised arms, slipping through gaps.

Dale's voice rang out again: "You've imprisoned twenty people in a bunker for weeks. You've drugged this congregation without their knowledge. You're planning to give them poisoned wine and call it ascension. Tell me how that's different from Jonestown."

"What bunker?" someone near Shauna shouted.

"Are we drugged?" another voice demanded.

Good, Shauna thought. The questions were spreading. Doubt was contagious.

She reached the stage's edge just as Dale said, "That wine has been tested. It contains sedatives—benzodiazepines. A nurse in this audience can testify to that. You've been drugged for weeks, made suggestible, made compliant."

Shauna didn't wait for an invitation. She climbed the stage steps, her medical bag bouncing against her hip.

"I'm the nurse," she called out, her voice cutting through the noise. "And everything he said is true."

Four hundred faces turned to her. The tent went quiet except for the shuffle of feet and the hum of the generators outside.

Shauna pulled the vial from her bag—the communion wine sample she'd taken three days ago. She held it up under the stage lights, then held up the testing strips.

"Benzodiazepines," she said, her ER nurse voice clear. "Sedative hypnotics. Same class as Valium. This concentration causes drowsiness, memory impairment, increased suggestibility, and psychological dependence."

She faced the congregation directly. "I'm an ER nurse from Houston Memorial. I've treated drug overdoses for six years. This wine is doped. You've all been drinking it for weeks. That's why you feel different. That's why everything Elijah says seems true. It's not faith—it's chemistry."

Someone in the crowd screamed, "She's lying! Satan sent her!"

But someone else shouted back, "Let her finish!"

And another voice: "I have felt different. I thought it was the Holy Spirit, but..."

The crowd fractured further. Arguments broke out—neighbors turning on each other, families divided, the social fabric tearing in real time.

Elijah stood frozen at the center of the stage, hands clenched. His white suit was damp with sweat now, hair wild from running his hands through it. The composed prophet was gone. What remained was a man losing control.

"You know nothing," Elijah said, but his voice lacked conviction. "God works through—"

"Through drugging people?" Shauna cut him off. "Through chemical manipulation? If your message requires sedatives to be believed, maybe it's not divine."

Dale stepped forward beside her. Together they faced Elijah—the failed seminary student and the ER nurse, two ordinary people calling out a prophet.

"Tell them about the bunker," Shauna said to Elijah. "Tell them where the seven missing people are. The ones their families think 'ascended early.'"

Elijah's face went pale. "They're preparing. They're blessed. They're—"

"They're imprisoned," Shauna snapped. "Underground. Drugged. Waiting to die at your command."

The congregation erupted. Shouts of outrage, denial, confusion. Some people surged toward the stage—Shauna couldn't tell if they wanted to attack her or demand answers from Elijah. The security guards moved forward uncertainly.

"Lies!" someone screamed. "Persecution!"

But more voices joined the opposition: "Where are they?" "Show us the bunker!" "What did you do to my daughter?"

Shauna saw it happening—the mass psychology breaking down, the spell Elijah had woven over weeks unraveling thread by thread. The drugs had made them compliant, but the drugs were wearing off. Reality was flooding back.

And Elijah saw it too.

His face cycled through emotions—denial, rage, desperation, and finally something that looked like grief. He grabbed the communion chalice from the table where he'd set it, held it up with shaking hands.

"You're destroying everything," he said, but Shauna noticed he wasn't looking at her or Dale. He was looking at empty space to his left. "I did what you asked. I gathered them. I prepared them. Why won't you help me now?"

Shauna's medical training kicked in. She recognized the signs—visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, addressing invisible presences. Schizophrenia, most likely. Or psychosis from another source. The man was genuinely mentally ill.

"Elijah," she said carefully, the way she'd speak to psych patients in the ER. "There's no one there. You need help."

"HE'S THERE!" Elijah screamed. He spun to face the congregation, arms spread, chalice sloshing wine onto the stage. "The angel! The tall figure in white! You've all seen him! Tell them! Tell her I'm not crazy!"

Silence. Then murmurs. Then voices:

"I... I did see something. At the services."

"Me too. Tall. In the shadows."

"I thought it was the light playing tricks..."

Shauna's skepticism wavered for a moment. Too many people describing the same thing. But no—that was the drugs. Shared hallucination was possible with the right chemical cocktail and environmental cues. Had to be.

"Group hallucination," she said firmly. "The benzodiazepines combined with suggestion and controlled lighting. You saw what he wanted you to see."

"No!" Elijah's voice cracked. "It's real. HE's real. I'm not insane. I'm not—" He looked at the empty space again, and his face crumpled. "Tell them. Please. Show them you're real."

Nothing happened. The tent stayed exactly as it was—hot, bright, full of frightened people watching their prophet beg the air for vindication.

Dale stepped closer to Elijah. "He's mentally ill," Dale said gently to the congregation. "I think he genuinely believes God speaks to him. But that doesn't make it real. Schizophrenia feels real to the person experiencing it. Delusions are indistinguishable from reality to the delusional."

He turned to Elijah. "You need treatment. Medication. Therapy. Not followers. Not a congregation. Help."

Elijah's face twisted. The grief transformed back to rage. "I don't need help. I need FAITH. And you've destroyed it. You've ruined God's plan." He lifted the chalice higher. "But I can still prove it. I can still show you all."

Shauna's blood went cold. She knew what he was about to do.

"That wine is poisoned," she said sharply. "Not just sedatives. Arsenic. Enough to kill you in minutes."

The congregation gasped.

Elijah smiled—a broken, terrible smile. "Good. Death is the doorway. I'll die and ascend, and you'll all see. You'll see I was right."

"That's suicide," Shauna said. "Not ascension. You'll just be dead."

"I'll be transformed." Elijah's hands were steady now, certainty returning in its most dangerous form. "I'll pass through and return to tell you. Or I'll ascend and you'll witness it. Either way, my faith will be proven."

He raised the chalice to his lips.

Shauna moved.

Six years of ER trauma response—you don't think, you act. She'd tackled drunk drivers trying to leave the hospital, restrained violent patients, stopped suicides in triage. Her body knew what to do before her brain finished processing.

She slammed into Elijah from the side.

He was bigger, but she was compact and low. Her shoulder hit his ribs, her weight driving him off balance. The chalice flew from his hands.

It hit the stage floor with a crash. The silver vessel shattered. Dark red wine spread across the wood like blood, pooling in the cracks, dripping through to the dirt below.

Elijah fell hard, Shauna on top of him. She pinned his arms, used her body weight to keep him down. He struggled, but she'd restrained bigger men.

"Let me up!" Elijah screamed. "Let me prove it! Let me show you!"

"Not today," Shauna grunted.

The congregation was in full riot now. Some people were rushing the stage to help Elijah. Others were fleeing the tent entirely. Security guards didn't know who to restrain—the nurse and seminary student, or the prophet trying to drink poison?

Dale shouted into the microphone: "The bunker is under the stage! Levon is evacuating prisoners right now! If anyone wants to help, if anyone wants to do something good, help get those people to safety!"

Shauna saw movement at the tent's edge—Levon appearing from the prayer tent area, a dazed woman in a white robe leaning on him. Then another prisoner. Then more, stumbling into the chaos, blinking in the lights.

The families who'd been told their loved ones "ascended" saw them. Mothers screamed. Fathers ran toward the stage. The reality of what had nearly happened—what Elijah had planned—became undeniable.

Under Shauna, Elijah stopped struggling. He went limp, staring at the spilled wine spreading across the stage.

"It's ruined," he whispered. "The plan is ruined. HE'll be angry. HE'll punish me."

"There is no 'he,'" Shauna said firmly. "It's your illness talking. That's all."

But Elijah's eyes fixed on something over her shoulder, and his face went white with terror.

"IT's here," he breathed. "IT's watching. Oh God. Oh God, it's not—" He thrashed suddenly, hard enough to nearly throw Shauna off. "I have to leave. I have to run. IT's—"

He twisted, broke free, scrambled to his feet.

Shauna grabbed for him but missed.

Elijah bolted. Off the stage, through the crowd, people scattering as he ran. His white suit flashed in the lights, then he was out the tent entrance, gone into the night.

Shauna stood slowly, breathing hard, hands shaking from adrenaline.

The tent was chaos—people crying, arguing, fleeing, reuniting with prisoners. The bunker captives stood confused and drugged, families embracing them. Security guards looked lost. The whole structure of Elijah's cult was collapsing in real time.

Dale approached, put a hand on her shoulder. "You okay?"

"Yeah." Shauna looked at the spilled wine soaking into the stage. Poison that would have killed hundreds, now just a stain. "Yeah. We did it."

"He's running."

"Let him run. The damage is done. The spell's broken. Look."

She gestured to the congregation. Individuals now, not a mob. People thinking again. Questioning again. The mass delusion was ending.

But somewhere in the back of her mind, Shauna heard Elijah's last words: "IT's not—"

Not what? Not God? Not what he thought?

She pushed the question away. Medical training: focus on what you can see, measure, prove. The man was psychotic. End of analysis.

But standing on that stage with poison soaking into the wood beneath her feet, Shauna couldn't quite shake the memory of Elijah's face when he'd looked over her shoulder.

He'd seen something.

Whether real or imagined, he'd absolutely believed it was there.

And it had terrified him more than death.
