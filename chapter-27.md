# Chapter 27: Departure Morning

Morning sun painted the motel parking lot gold. The Greyhound idled at the station three blocks away, engine rumbling, ready to carry them back to their separate lives.

Kimmy stood in Ruth's motel room watching her pack the last items into her suitcase. Three weeks in this room. Three weeks that had changed everything.

"I'm scared," Kimmy said quietly.

Ruth paused, folding a shirt. "Of what?"

"That I'll mess this up. The foster family, the school, everything you arranged. What if I'm not good enough? What if I'm still just a screwed-up runaway?"

Ruth set down the shirt and turned to face Kimmy fully. "You were never 'just' anything. You were a seventeen-year-old in a terrible situation who made the incredibly brave choice to leave. And when you got here, when Elijah offered you everything you were desperate for—belonging, purpose, family—you chose to walk away from that too. That's not screwed up. That's strength."

"I almost didn't walk away."

"But you did. That's what matters." Ruth gripped Kimmy's shoulders gently. "Listen to me. You're going to make mistakes. Everyone does. But you have support now. The foster family, the mentor program, counseling, and me. I'll be in El Paso. Twenty minutes away. You can call me every Sunday like we agreed, or more if you need to."

"Every Sunday," Kimmy repeated. "Promise?"

"I promise. And if I don't hear from you, I'm showing up at your door." Ruth managed a smile. "You're stuck with me now. Sorry."

Kimmy hugged her. Ruth stiffened for just a moment—still uncomfortable with affection—then hugged back.

"You saved me," Kimmy whispered.

"You saved yourself," Ruth corrected. "I just made sure you had somewhere safe to land."

A knock at the door. Shauna entered, her own bag packed, wearing the same professional competence she'd carried through the entire crisis.

"Bus leaves in thirty minutes," Shauna said. Then she looked at Kimmy. "You ready for this?"

"I think so."

"Good. Because if you're not, fake it until you are. That's how most of us get through life." Shauna's expression softened slightly. "But actually, you'll be fine. You're tougher than you think."

"How do you know?"

"Because tough people recognize each other." Shauna extended her hand formally. "Stay in touch. I want to hear about high school graduation."

Kimmy shook her hand, then hugged her instead. Shauna looked momentarily surprised, then awkwardly patted Kimmy's back.

"Okay, okay. Don't get sentimental on me."

Dale appeared in the doorway, looking exhausted. He'd been up all night reading Elijah's journal. The weight of it showed in his eyes.

"The bus?" he asked.

"Thirty minutes," Ruth confirmed. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Just... a lot to process." Dale managed a tired smile for Kimmy. "You're going to do great in El Paso. I expect to hear you're valedictorian."

"That's a lot of pressure," Kimmy said.

"Fine. Top ten percent. But I expect a high school graduation invitation."

"You'd come?"

"Of course I would. We're family now." Dale said it matter-of-factly, like it was obvious. "Found families count just as much as blood families. Sometimes more."

Levon was the last to arrive, carrying his single duffel bag. He looked around the motel room—the five of them gathered one last time.

"This is it, huh?" he said.

"This is it," Ruth agreed.

Silence settled. Not uncomfortable, just heavy with the weight of what they'd shared and what they were leaving.

"I got something for y'all," Levon said. He pulled five items from his duffel—cheap disposable cameras from the truck stop. "Before we split up. Picture of the group."

"That's surprisingly sentimental for you," Shauna said.

"Yeah, well." Levon shrugged. "Figured we should remember this. Might forget faces otherwise."

They gathered outside in the parking lot. Levon asked the motel clerk to take the photo. The five of them stood together—Ruth in the center, Kimmy beside her, Dale on the other side, Shauna and Levon flanking them.

The clerk snapped the picture. The flash popped. The camera whirred advancing film.

"One more," Ruth said. "Just to be safe."

They took three more—one serious, one with Dale making Kimmy laugh, one with all of them looking exhausted but genuinely happy.

"I'll get these developed and send copies to everyone," Levon said. "Got all your addresses."

They walked to the bus station together. The morning was already hot, Texas sun beating down. The revival tent was gone completely now—just empty field, fresh dirt where the bunker entrance had been sealed.

At the station, they stood on the platform watching the bus load. Other passengers boarded—people with their own lives, their own destinations, oblivious to what had happened here three weeks ago.

"Levon Ritter?" A voice called. A man in a suit approached, mid-forties, badge visible. "I'm Officer Martinez, your parole officer."

Levon tensed. "Sir. I wasn't expecting—"

"Relax. I'm not here to violate you." Martinez extended his hand. "I'm here to shake your hand. What you did here—saving those people—that's exactly what successful rehabilitation looks like. You should be proud."

Levon shook his hand, throat tight. "Thank you, sir."

"Dallas check-in is still required next week. But after that, I'm recommending early termination of parole. You've earned it." Martinez nodded to the group. "All of you. The state owes you a debt."

He left. Levon stood staring after him.

"Early termination," he said quietly. "I could be off parole. Free."

"You earned it," Ruth said.

The bus driver called final boarding.

Shauna was first. She hugged Kimmy quickly, shook hands with Dale and Levon, and gave Ruth a brief embrace. "Stay in touch. I mean it."

"I will," Ruth promised.

Shauna boarded, finding a seat near the back, already pulling out a medical journal to read. Back to her life, her ER shifts, her careful professional distance from emotion.

But she looked back once through the window. Gave a small wave.

Dale was next. He hugged Kimmy longer than was strictly necessary. "Remember—phone call anytime. I don't care if it's three AM. You need to talk, you call."

"I will."

He shook Levon's hand firmly. "You're a good man. Don't let anyone tell you different."

"You too, preacher."

Dale smiled. "Not a preacher. Just a guy who knows theology."

"Same thing, basically."

Dale hugged Ruth. "Thank you for organizing us. For making us a team. I don't think any of us could have done this alone."

"We saved each other," Ruth said. "That's how it works."

Dale boarded, finding a seat near the middle, already pulling out a theology book to read. Back to his life, his studies, his search for purpose in protecting people from twisted faith.

Levon shifted his duffel. "Guess it's my turn."

Kimmy hugged him hard. "Thank you for protecting us. For being brave."

"Wasn't brave. Just did what needed doing." But Levon's voice was rough. "You take care of yourself, kid. Finish school. Be somebody."

"I will."

Levon looked at Ruth. "You're good people, Ruth Morrison. Those kids in El Paso are lucky to have you teaching them."

"Thank you. And Levon—you're good people too. Whatever you were before, you're better now. Remember that."

He nodded, unable to speak, and boarded quickly before emotion could overwhelm him.

The bus driver started closing the door. Ruth and Kimmy stepped back.

Inside, visible through windows, the three of them found their seats. Dale near the middle, reading. Shauna in back, clinical distance maintained. Levon in front, staring out the window at the town that had changed him.

The bus pulled away.

Ruth and Kimmy watched it disappear down the highway, carrying three-fifths of their found family back to separate lives.

"Will we really stay in touch?" Kimmy asked.

"Yes," Ruth said with certainty. "We will. Some bonds don't break just because geography changes."

They stood in silence for a moment. Then Ruth checked her watch. "We should go. Your foster family is expecting us at noon for introductions."

"I'm really scared," Kimmy admitted again.

"I know. That's normal. But you're not alone anymore. You have me, you have the Hendersons, you have support. You're going to be okay."

They walked to Ruth's car—rented for the drive to El Paso. Kimmy put her bag in the back. Her entire life fit in one backpack and a garbage bag. But it was more than she'd had three weeks ago.

Three weeks ago, she'd been suicidal, desperate, running from abuse toward nothing.

Now she had somewhere to go. Someone to call family. A future that extended beyond next week.

They drove out of town, passing the crossroads where the bus had broken down, passing the truck stop where they'd eaten their last meal together, passing the empty field where the revival tent had stood.

"Do you think it was real?" Kimmy asked. "The thing Elijah saw?"

Ruth considered carefully. "I think something happened. Whether it was real or illness, I don't know. Maybe both. Maybe neither. But I know this—we stopped people from dying. That's real. The rest is mystery, and maybe that's okay."

"How do you live with mystery?"

"By focusing on what you can know. What you can control. What you can do." Ruth glanced at Kimmy. "You can't control whether something supernatural exists. But you can control whether you finish high school, whether you build healthy relationships, whether you create a good life. Focus on that."

Kimmy nodded slowly. "Okay. I can do that."

They drove toward El Paso and new beginnings.

Behind them, the crossroads town grew smaller in the rearview mirror, until it vanished entirely.

But the bonds formed there remained.

Found family, forged in crisis, tested by horror, proven by courage.

Ruth glanced at Kimmy—no longer a desperate runaway but a young woman with possibility ahead—and allowed herself a small smile.

They'd done good.

And tomorrow, they'd do it again in smaller ways.

Teaching, healing, building, growing.

Normal life, extraordinary in its ordinary goodness.

The road stretched ahead, and they drove toward it together.
