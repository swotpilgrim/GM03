# Chapter 2: The Empty Town

## Ruth

The library was closed.

Ruth stood on the concrete steps, hand on the locked door, reading the faded hours sign. Monday-Friday, 9 AM to 4 PM. It was two-thirty on a Tuesday afternoon.

She cupped her hands against the glass, peering inside. Dusty shelves, a circulation desk with yesterday's newspaper spread across it. Everything looked recently abandoned, like someone had just stepped out.

No "Back Soon" sign. Just locked doors and silence.

She walked the building's perimeter. All windows dark. The book drop slot was full—returns nobody had collected. She noted it in her spiral notebook: *Library closed despite posted hours.*

She moved on to the sheriff's office two blocks over. The heat was oppressive, Main Street empty of cars and people. The whole town felt like a stage set between performances.

The sheriff's office was a squat concrete building with barred windows. The door stood open. Ruth climbed the steps, called inside.

"Hello?"

Nothing.

She entered cautiously. A reception desk with a CB radio crackling static, a dispatcher's chair pushed back. Papers scattered across the desk—incident reports, a half-eaten sandwich on wax paper.

"Sheriff?" Ruth called again.

Silence except for the CB radio hissing.

She retreated outside, unsettled. First the library, now the sheriff's office. Everyone was somewhere else. That tent on the horizon, white canvas rippling in the hot wind.

The elementary school was at the end of Main Street, a low brick building with a fenced playground. Closed for summer. But revival flyers were stapled to every telephone pole along the sidewalk. "WITNESS MIRACLES. FIND SALVATION. PREACHER ELIJAH CAINE, EVENING SERVICES 7 PM."

Every pole. Every surface.

Ruth tore one down, folded it, tucked it in her notebook.

## Dale

The First Baptist Church sat on a corner lot, white clapboard siding, modest steeple. Dale approached it like a pilgrim.

The front door was unlocked. He entered a small vestibule, then the sanctuary—twelve rows of pews, a simple altar, a wooden cross. Hymnals scattered in the pews like someone had left mid-service.

Dale walked down the center aisle, his footsteps echoing. The place smelled like old wood and mothballs. Holy and abandoned at the same time.

He sat in the front pew, looking up at the cross. Four years of seminary, and he'd quit. Walked away because he couldn't reconcile what he'd learned with what the institution demanded.

But this place felt like what church was supposed to be.

Except everyone had left.

He moved to the bulletin board in the vestibule. The last entry was two weeks ago—"Visiting preacher, revival tent, fairgrounds." Someone had written: "All services moved to tent until further notice."

The entire congregation had decamped to Elijah Caine's revival.

Dale examined the corkboard. Beneath the calendar, dozens of flyers advertised Elijah's services. Testimonials in handwriting: "He healed my daughter." "I felt God's presence." "Brother Caine speaks truth."

Dale's stomach tightened. This was how it started. Charismatic preacher arrives, promises miracles, congregation follows. The institutional church gets abandoned for the spectacle.

He'd studied this pattern in seminary. Some revivals were genuine. Others were cons, pure theater.

Elijah Caine. Dale made a mental note to research him.

He left the church, locking the door behind him carefully—a reflex of respect for holy spaces. Outside, the heat hit him again. Across the street, the revival tent was visible between buildings, white canvas against blue sky.

Everyone had gone to the tent.

Everyone.

## Shauna

The Rexall pharmacy was attached to the diner, a narrow space with checkerboard linoleum and shelves of medicine bottles. Shauna entered with her large purse, ostensibly looking for aspirin.

The pharmacist stood behind the counter—sixty-something, thin hair combed over a spotted scalp, bifocals on a chain. He smiled when she entered, a beatific expression that made Shauna's professional instincts flare.

"Help you, miss?"

"Aspirin," Shauna said. "And bandages if you have them."

"Aisle two." He gestured vaguely, his movements slow, dreamy.

Shauna found the supplies and brought them to the counter. While he rang them up, she observed him clinically. Dilated pupils despite the bright overhead lights. Slight hand tremor. Delayed responses, like his brain was processing through fog.

"You're new in town," he said. Not a question.

"Bus broke down. Waiting for repairs."

"Ahh. Well, you're here now. You should come to the revival. Preacher Caine does miracles." The pharmacist held up his hands, flexed his fingers. "My arthritis was so bad I couldn't count pills. He laid hands on me, and the pain left. Gone. Like it was never there."

Shauna looked at his hands. No swelling, no joint deformation. But arthritis didn't just vanish. Pain management, yes. Inflammation reduction, possible. Miracle cure? No.

"That's wonderful," she said neutrally. "How long ago?"

"A week. Maybe ten days. I've been to every service since. Can't miss them. It's like... when I'm in that tent, everything makes sense. I feel connected to something bigger."

His pupils were so dilated she could barely see the iris. Shauna had worked ER long enough to recognize pharmaceutical influence. This wasn't religious ecstasy. This was chemical.

"What's your name?" she asked.

"Martin." His smile was gentle, vacant.

"Martin, do you take any medications? For the arthritis?"

"Used to. Don't need them anymore."

"Nothing at all?"

"Well, I take communion at the services. Preacher Caine blesses it personally. Wine and wafer. That's the only medicine I need now."

Communion. Wine. Shauna paid for her items and left quickly, her mind working through possibilities. If Elijah was drugging the wine—low-dose benzodiazepines, maybe, something to induce calm and suggestibility—that would explain the town-wide dreamy affect. Long-term exposure would create dependency, both physical and psychological.

She needed to test that wine. Get a sample, use her field kit.

But first she needed to tell the others.

## Levon

Levon scouted the town like he was casing it for a job. Old habits.

He walked the perimeter—four blocks north to south, five blocks east to west. What he found didn't make him happy.

No car rental. No taxi service. The gas station's mechanic sign said "At revival tent, back at 7 PM." No cars for sale. The Greyhound was their only transportation, and it was dead.

The nearest town was sixty miles east. Too far to walk in this heat. The highway had been empty all afternoon.

They were trapped.

He circled back to the motel. Population eight hundred, but he'd seen maybe twenty people all afternoon—all with that same glazed, dreamy look. Like sleepwalkers. Like junkies on a really good high.

Levon knew that look. He'd seen it in prison—guys on smuggled pills, floating through their sentences. It never lasted.

At the motel office, he found the clerk still reading his newspaper. Levon leaned against the counter.

"Quiet town," he said.

"Usually is." The clerk turned a page without looking up.

"Everybody at the revival?"

"Most folks. Preacher Caine's done wonders for this place. Given people hope. Purpose. We were dying before he came—kids leaving, businesses closing, nothing but dust and heat. Now we got something to believe in."

"What about the sheriff? He at the revival too?"

"Brother Caine holds special prayer sessions for town leadership. Sheriff goes every afternoon. Says it helps him keep the peace." The clerk finally looked up, eyes distant behind thick glasses. "You should go tonight. Seven PM service. It'll change your life."

"I'm good," Levon said.

"Everyone says that at first. Then they go. Then they understand."

Levon left before the clerk could say more. Outside, he lit a cigarette and watched the revival tent shimmer in the heat. The singing had started again—hundreds of voices, hymns carrying across the empty streets.

Special prayer sessions for leadership. That explained why the sheriff's office was empty. Elijah had the authorities in his pocket—not through corruption, but through whatever he was doing in that tent.

Levon had done time with cult guys before. True believers were more dangerous than any criminal because they thought God justified everything. And if Elijah had the whole town converted...

They needed to be careful.

## Evening

They reconvened at the diner as the sun sank toward the horizon, turning the sky orange and purple. Ruth arrived first, then Shauna, then Dale. Levon came last, cigarette dangling from his lips.

The same waitress from earlier brought coffee without asking. Same beatific smile. Same dreamy movements.

"Y'all decide to go to the service tonight?" she asked hopefully.

"Maybe," Ruth said.

When the waitress left, Ruth opened her notebook and shared what she'd found. Dale described the abandoned church. Shauna reported the pharmacist's symptoms and the communion wine suspicion. Levon delivered the bad news about being trapped.

They sat in silence, processing.

"So the whole town's been drugged," Shauna said quietly. "Through communion wine. That's the working theory."

"The whole town's in a cult," Dale corrected. "Whether drugged or psychologically controlled, the effect is the same."

"We're stuck here for three days," Levon added. "No way out except that bus."

Ruth looked at each of them. "We should attend a service. Tomorrow morning. See what we're dealing with."

"I'm not drinking any communion wine," Shauna said flatly.

"None of us will," Ruth agreed. "We observe. We stay together. We protect Kimmy."

"Where is she?" Dale asked, suddenly realizing the girl wasn't with them.

"Her room," Ruth said. "I checked on her an hour ago. She was sketching."

"She wants to go," Dale said. "To the revival. She asked about it."

Ruth's jaw tightened. "Then we take her. Tomorrow morning. And we don't let her out of our sight."

"This is a bad idea," Levon said.

"We have three days here," Ruth countered. "We need to understand what's happening. Knowledge is—"

"Power, yeah, I get it. I also get that walking into a cult compound voluntarily is how people end up dead."

"We'll be careful."

Levon stubbed out his cigarette. "You people are too curious for your own good."

But he didn't leave. None of them did.

Outside, the singing grew louder as evening service began. Hundreds of voices raised in praise, the sound rolling across the empty town like a wave.

Ruth made notes. Shauna planned how to get a wine sample. Dale thought about theological arguments. Levon counted exits.

And in her motel room, Kimmy stood at the window, staring at the tent, feeling the pull of those voices like a rope around her chest.

Tomorrow they would go to the revival.

Tomorrow they would meet Elijah Caine.
