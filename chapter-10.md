# Chapter 10: Levon's Surveillance

Levon knew how to disappear.

Six years inside taught you that. How to become invisible, blend with walls, move without sound. How to watch without being watched. How to read patterns, spot weaknesses, plan escapes.

Skills the system punished him for using.

Skills that might save seven people tonight.

He'd positioned himself behind the equipment shed two hundred yards northeast of the revival tent. Good sight line, concealed by shadow, downwind so dogs wouldn't catch his scent. Not that he'd seen dogs, but you planned for everything.

The evening service had ended an hour ago. Most of the congregation had dispersed—five hundred people streaming out like ants, peaceful and slow. Elijah had blessed them from the stage, white suit glowing under lights, voice carrying across the field.

But not everyone left.

Levon counted twelve people who stayed. Elijah's inner circle—the volunteers who ran the tent, managed logistics, handled security. They moved between the main tent and smaller support structures with purposeful efficiency.

And they kept returning to one specific tent. The prayer tent behind the stage. The one with a padlock.

Levon pulled out his camera—used Nikon with telephoto lens he'd bought at a pawn shop for twenty dollars. He clicked photos systematically. Each person. Each trip to the locked tent. Each delivery.

Because they were definitely making deliveries.

At ten o'clock, two men carried cases of bottled water into the prayer tent. Unlocked it, descended—stairs visible briefly before the tent flap closed. Emerged ten minutes later empty-handed.

At eleven, a woman brought a cooler. Same process. Down the stairs, ten minutes, back up.

Levon made notes in his pocket notebook. *Food and water deliveries to underground location. Quantities suggest multiple people. Seven? More?*

The generator trucks bothered him. Three of them, parked on the tent's north side, running constantly. Diesel hum constant in the night. Generators that size powered something major—industrial lighting, maybe. Or ventilation.

Ventilation for what?

Levon waited. Patience was survival. You didn't rush in prison—rushed movements got you noticed, got you hurt. You waited. Observed. Learned patterns.

At midnight, the inner circle retreated to their trailers—RVs and Airstreams parked in a cluster two hundred yards west. Lights went out one by one. The compound settled into darkness except for security lights around the main tent.

Levon stayed perfectly still. Waiting.

At 3 AM, Elijah emerged from his trailer.

Levon's breath caught. He raised the camera, adjusted focus.

Elijah walked across the dark field alone. No white suit now—just jeans and a work shirt. He looked smaller somehow. Human. He approached the prayer tent, pulled out a key, unlocked the padlock.

Then he descended.

The tent flap stayed open for five seconds—long enough for Levon to see. Steel stairs leading down into darkness. A hatch, military-grade. Concrete walls.

Bunker. It was a goddamn bunker.

The flap closed. Elijah disappeared underground.

Levon checked his watch. Noted the time. 3:07 AM.

He waited.

One hour later, Elijah emerged.

Even from two hundred yards away, Levon could see the change. Elijah moved slowly, shoulders slumped. He locked the tent, stood there for a moment with his hand on the padlock. His face—Levon zoomed in with the camera, clicked—looked haunted. Exhausted. Not the charismatic preacher from the stage. Just a man carrying something terrible.

Elijah walked back to his trailer. The door closed.

Levon lowered the camera. His heart hammered.

What the hell was Elijah doing down there for an hour in the middle of the night?

Levon moved. Finally. His legs ached from three hours of stillness, but he ignored it. He circled the compound perimeter, staying in shadows, using trees and equipment for cover.

The generator trucks were definitely ventilating something. He could hear the hum, feel the vibration in the ground. Following the sound, he found ventilation shafts—three of them, camouflaged by brush but visible if you knew what to look for. Industrial fans pulling air down, exhausting it up.

Underground bunker. Had to be.

He examined the stage platform. Built on concrete foundation, not dirt. The foundation extended beyond the stage—thirty feet in every direction. Too large for just a stage support. This was structural. A roof for something below.

Levon had done time with a guy who'd worked construction. Military contracts, Cold War era. Fallout shelters, bunkers, missile silos. The man had described them—concrete reinforced, underground, designed to house people during nuclear attack.

This fit the description.

Levon took photos. The concrete foundation. The ventilation shafts. The generator trucks. The locked prayer tent. Every angle, every detail.

Evidence.

He checked his watch. 4:30 AM. Dawn would come soon. He needed to move.

Circling back to his original position, Levon reviewed his notes:

- Locked prayer tent with steel hatch and stairs descending to bunker
- Food and water deliveries suggesting multiple people imprisoned below
- Generators running 24/7 for ventilation
- Concrete foundation approximately 30x30 feet under main tent
- Elijah's late-night visit: 3:07 AM to 4:11 AM, emerged looking distressed
- Estimated bunker capacity: unknown, but Cold War era shelters typically held 50-200 people
- Security weaknesses: minimal overnight guards, single padlock on prayer tent entrance, generators create noise cover

Levon sat back against the equipment shed. His hands were steady despite the adrenaline. This was his element—surveillance, planning, criminal assessment. Skills that got him locked up now serving a good purpose.

But if he got caught, he'd go back inside. Parole violation. Breaking and entering. Conspiracy. Five years minimum, probably more.

Ruth's words from yesterday echoed: *We need your help.*

Shauna's quiet determination: *Seven people's lives.*

Dale's fear masked as theology: *He's building toward mass death.*

Kimmy's sketches of them as heroes.

Levon looked at his forearm. Fresh scar where he'd had prison ink partially removed—crude tattoo from his early twenties, symbol of allegiance to people who'd abandoned him the moment he got arrested. He'd spent good money getting it lasered off. Trying to erase who he'd been.

But maybe who he'd been wasn't all bad. Maybe those skills had value if used right.

Seven people down there. Maybe more. Imprisoned, drugged, being prepared for something horrible.

And five strangers up here trying to stop it.

Levon packed his equipment—camera, notes, binoculars. The eastern sky was lightening. Time to move.

He walked back through pre-dawn darkness, staying off roads, using fields and tree lines. Forty minutes later, he reached the motel.

Ruth's room. He knocked quietly.

She opened the door immediately, fully dressed. Like she'd been waiting.

"Did you find something?"

"Found everything."

The others gathered quickly. Dale stumbled in with bedhead and his briefcase. Shauna arrived with her medical kit and camera. Kimmy appeared last, sketchbook clutched to her chest.

Levon spread his notes and photos on the bed.

"There's a bunker. Cold War era, underground, beneath the main tent. Concrete foundation, steel hatch entrance through the prayer tent, ventilation shafts running 24/7. They're keeping people down there."

Ruth leaned forward. "You're sure?"

"Positive. I watched them deliver food and water all night. Quantities for multiple people. And Elijah went down there alone at three in the morning. Stayed an hour. Came back looking like he'd seen hell."

Dale examined the photos. "This concrete foundation—it extends how far?"

"Thirty feet in every direction from the stage. Maybe bigger underground. Those old fallout shelters were designed for fifty to two hundred people."

Shauna picked up the photo of Elijah emerging from the bunker. "He looks exhausted."

"Haunted," Levon corrected. "Like whatever he's doing down there is eating him alive."

"But he's still doing it," Ruth said quietly.

"Yeah."

Kimmy spoke up, voice small. "Are they alive? The missing people?"

"Food and water deliveries suggest yes. You don't feed dead people."

Ruth made notes in her spiral notebook. "So we have location confirmed. Access point identified. Pattern of deliveries. What about security?"

Levon appreciated her tactical thinking. "Minimal overnight. Maybe two guys on rotation, but they stay near the trailers. Single padlock on the prayer tent entrance—I can pick it in thirty seconds. Generators create noise cover. Sight lines are good for us if we time it during a service when Elijah's occupied."

"Tomorrow night," Dale said. "Evening service."

"We infiltrate the bunker," Shauna added. "Document what's inside. Gather evidence they can't ignore."

Levon pulled out his tactical diagram—hand-drawn map of the compound showing entry points, sight lines, security positions, escape routes.

"Here's how we do it."

He explained the plan. Ruth and Kimmy stay topside, attend the service, ready to create distractions if needed. Levon picks the prayer tent lock. Dale and Shauna descend with him. Document everything—photographs, medical evaluations, testimonies if the prisoners can speak.

"Timeline: ninety minutes maximum. In at seven-thirty when the service starts. Out by nine. Elijah's services run two to three hours, so we'll have time."

"What if we're caught?" Dale asked.

Levon met his eyes. "If we're caught, I go back to prison. Parole violation, breaking and entering, conspiracy. Five years minimum. You three are accessories to felony. First offense might get probation, might not."

Silence.

"But seven people are down there," Levon continued. "Maybe more. And Elijah's planning something worse. So we risk it anyway."

Ruth stood. "Agreed."

Shauna nodded. "Agreed."

Dale hesitated, then: "Agreed."

Kimmy clutched her sketchbook. "I'll create a distraction if you need it. I can do that."

Levon felt something unfamiliar. Not fear. Not adrenaline. Something warmer.

Purpose. Belonging.

"Get some sleep," he said. "We move tomorrow night."

They dispersed to their rooms. Levon stayed in Ruth's room, studying his diagrams, refining the plan.

Ruth brought coffee. Sat across from him.

"Why are you doing this?" she asked. "Really. You could leave. Get on a bus tomorrow when they fix it. Walk away."

Levon thought about that. "I spent six years inside for robbing people who could afford it. Stupid, yeah. But I never hurt anybody who didn't deserve it. Elijah's hurting people who've done nothing wrong. Kids maybe. And the system won't stop him because he's wearing a white suit and calling it God's work."

"So this is justice?"

"This is me choosing who I want to be." Levon looked at his scarred forearm. "I can't erase my past. But maybe I can be useful anyway."

Ruth smiled. Tired but genuine. "You already are."

Outside, dawn broke over Crossroads. One more day until they'd go underground into Elijah's bunker.

One more day until they'd find out what he was hiding.

Levon finished his coffee, studying the compound diagram. Entry points. Escape routes. Contingencies.

Criminal skills serving a good purpose.

He could work with that.
