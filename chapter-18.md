# Chapter 18: Theological Showdown

Dale's heart hammered. The aisle stretched before him—four hundred hostile faces, and at the end, Elijah Caine waiting.

Every instinct screamed to run.

Instead, Dale walked.

Past the folding chairs. Past families who'd been neighbors for two weeks, now strangers with angry eyes. Someone spat at his feet. Someone hissed, "Blasphemer."

Elijah's security didn't move. The two men flanking the stage stood still because Elijah had waved them down. His curiosity outweighed caution.

Dale reached the stage steps. Climbed them. His legs felt like water.

The stage lights were blinding—hot bulbs that turned everything beyond the first rows into darkness. He couldn't see Ruth, Shauna, or Levon. He was alone with Elijah and four hundred believers.

Elijah stood ten feet away, still holding the chalice. Up close, he was even more imposing—tall, broad, silver hair gleaming, eyes calm and amused. He smiled like a teacher humoring a confused student.

"Welcome, friend," Elijah said, his voice carrying easily without amplification. "You have something to say to these good people?"

Dale stepped to the second microphone stand at the stage's edge. He gripped it with both hands to stop them from shaking. The metal was warm from the lights.

"I do," Dale said. His voice came out thin, reedy. He cleared his throat, tried again. "I have something to say about false prophets."

Gasps from the congregation. Shouts of protest.

Elijah raised a hand, and they quieted. "Go on."

Dale drew a breath. Four years of seminary. Every theological debate he'd lost. Every time he'd been told to submit instead of question. It had led to this moment.

"Revelation 22:18," he said, voice stronger now. "'For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book.'"

Silence. Four hundred people listening.

Dale looked at Elijah. "You've added yourself into prophecy. You claim you're God's instrument for the end times. You claim you can trigger the ascension. But you're not mentioned in scripture. You're not prophesied. You've added your own authority to God's word. That makes you a false prophet."

The silence broke. Shouting from the congregation—some defending Elijah, some uncertain, all loud.

Elijah's smile didn't waver. "I add nothing, child. I simply speak the truth God has revealed to me. He works through vessels. Moses was a vessel. Paul was a vessel. Why not Elijah Caine?"

"Because Moses had miracles that could be verified," Dale shot back. "Paul had witnesses to his conversion. You have... what? Parlor tricks? Cold reading? Drugged wine?"

More gasps. The crowd's energy shifted—confusion mixing with the anger.

"Careful, boy." Elijah's voice stayed calm, but his eyes hardened. "You accuse God's servant of deception?"

"I accuse you of exploiting people's faith." Dale's hands stopped shaking. The fear was still there, but buried under something hotter—righteous anger at watching vulnerable people manipulated. "First Thessalonians 5:2: 'For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.' It's not scheduled. You can't predict it. You can't cause it through a ceremony."

Dale took a step forward. "But you claim tonight is that day? That drinking your communion wine will trigger the rapture? That's not theology—that's blasphemy. You're putting yourself in God's place."

Murmurs rippled through the congregation now. Dale saw heads turning, people whispering to each other. The unified certainty was cracking.

Elijah set the chalice down on the communion table. He walked slowly toward Dale, hands spread in a gesture of openness. "You quote scripture well. You've studied, clearly. But you mistake the letter for the spirit."

"Do I?" Dale stood his ground. "Matthew 24:36: 'But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.' Jesus himself said no one knows when the end comes. But you claim to know? You claim you can trigger it?"

Dale turned to face the congregation, raising his voice. "Either Jesus was wrong, or Elijah Caine is. Which is more likely?"

The whispers grew louder. Dale saw uncertainty on faces now—doubt creeping in where certainty had been.

Elijah's composure slipped for the first time. His jaw tightened. "You twist my words. I don't claim to know the hour—I claim God has revealed it to me. There's a difference."

"Is there?" Dale turned back to him. "Every false prophet in history has claimed special revelation. David Koresh claimed it. Jim Jones claimed it. Charles Manson claimed God spoke to him. They all heard voices. They all promised salvation. They all delivered death instead."

The comparison landed like a bomb. Dale saw it in the congregation's faces—recognition, horror, the sudden connection between Elijah and those other names. Names synonymous with cult massacres.

"How dare you." Elijah's voice was cold now, the warmth gone. "How dare you compare me to murderers and madmen."

"Am I wrong?" Dale pressed. He felt momentum shifting, the crowd's certainty breaking down. "You've imprisoned twenty people in a bunker for weeks. You've drugged this congregation without their knowledge. You're planning to give them poisoned wine and call it ascension. Tell me how that's different from Jonestown."

Someone in the crowd screamed, "He's lying!"

But someone else shouted, "What bunker?"

And another: "Are we drugged?"

The congregation fractured before Dale's eyes—some still defending Elijah, others questioning, all talking at once. The unified mass breaking into individuals capable of doubt.

Elijah's face went dark. "You know nothing of God's plan."

"I know scripture," Dale said. He felt his voice settling into the cadence he'd learned in seminary—the rhythm of preaching, of teaching, of making truth understood. "First John 4:1: 'Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.' We're commanded to test prophets. To question. To verify."

He turned to the congregation again. "You've been told to have faith. To trust without questioning. But blind faith isn't biblical faith. Real faith tests itself. Real faith asks hard questions."

Dale pointed to the communion chalice. "That wine has been tested. It contains sedatives—benzodiazepines. A nurse in this audience can testify to that. You've been drugged for weeks, made suggestible, made compliant. That's not God's work. That's manipulation."

More shouts. The congregation was chaos now—some standing to leave, others surging forward angrily, everyone yelling. The unified worship service had become something else entirely.

Elijah grabbed Dale's arm. His grip was iron-strong, fingers digging in. "You've destroyed everything," he hissed, his face inches from Dale's. "God spoke to me. He told me what to do. You're interfering with His plan."

"Or I'm stopping yours," Dale said quietly.

They stood frozen—Elijah towering over him, Dale meeting his eyes.

Then Dale saw it: the moment Elijah's certainty broke.

A flicker in those blue eyes, a tremor in the hand gripping Dale's arm. Doubt. Real doubt beneath the prophetic confidence.

"He speaks to me," Elijah said, voice quieter now, almost pleading. "I hear Him. I see the angels. They tell me what to do."

"I know," Dale said. "I believe you hear voices and see things. But that doesn't make them God."

Elijah's hand dropped. He stepped back, eyes unfocused, listening to something only he could hear.

"No," Elijah whispered. "No, I did everything right. I followed the plan. I gathered the souls. I prepared them. Tonight is the night. Tonight we ascend."

He wasn't talking to Dale anymore. He was talking to the empty air beside him, addressing something invisible.

Dale felt a cold finger run down his spine. This wasn't an act. Elijah genuinely saw something standing there.

The congregation had gone quiet, watching their prophet argue with nothing.

"Tell them," Elijah said to the empty space. "Tell them I'm not false. Show them. Give me a sign."

Nothing happened. The tent stayed exactly as it was—hot, bright, full of confused and frightened people.

Elijah's face crumpled. "Please. I did everything You asked. Why won't You show them?"

Dale took a step forward. "Elijah. There's no one there. You're ill. Let us help you."

"HE'S THERE!" Elijah screamed. He spun to face the congregation, arms spread wide. "You see Him too! The angel! The tall figure in white! You've all seen Him at the services!"

Some people nodded—uncertain, frightened. Others looked around, seeing nothing.

"That's shared hallucination," Dale said gently. "The drugs and suggestion created it. There's no angel."

"There is." Elijah's voice broke. "There has to be. Because if there isn't, then I've done all of this for nothing. I've hurt people. I've lied. I've..." He looked at the communion chalice, then at the bunker prisoners standing blank-faced in their white robes. "Oh God. What have I done?"

For just a moment, Dale saw not a charismatic prophet but a broken man realizing the depth of his own delusion.

Then Elijah's eyes refocused. The moment of clarity passed. His face hardened with renewed certainty—or desperate need to believe.

"No," Elijah said. "No, you're the liar. You're testing my faith. That's what this is—a test. And I won't fail."

He grabbed the communion chalice from the table, held it high.

"I'll prove my faith," Elijah said. "I'll prove God chose me. I'll drink first. I'll ascend first. And you'll all see."

Dale's blood went cold. "Elijah, don't—"

But Elijah raised the chalice to his lips.

The poisoned wine glinted dark red under the lights.

And from the side of the stage, a woman's voice shouted: "STOP! That wine is poison!"

Shauna emerged from the crowd, holding up a vial and testing strips, her medical evidence visible to everyone.

"Arsenic," she called out. "Enough to kill every person in this tent. I tested it. I can prove it. If you drink that, Elijah Caine, you'll die. And it won't be ascension—it'll be suicide."

The congregation erupted into chaos.

And in that chaos, Dale saw Elijah's face cycle through emotions—denial, confusion, rage, and finally, terrifying certainty.

"Good," Elijah whispered. "Death is the doorway. I'll show you all."

He tipped the chalice toward his mouth.

Dale lunged forward, grabbing for it—but strong hands caught him. Elijah's security, finally moving, pulling Dale back.

"Let him drink!" someone from the crowd shouted.

"Stop him!" someone else screamed.

The tent descended into riot.

And Elijah Caine stood alone at the center of it all, holding poison to his lips, tears streaming down his face, whispering, "I believe, I believe, I believe."

The chalice tilted.

One drop of dark red wine touched his lips.

Then Shauna was there, slamming into Elijah from the side, knocking the chalice from his hands.

It crashed to the stage floor, shattering. Red wine spread across the wood like blood.

Like a sign of things to come.
