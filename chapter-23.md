# Chapter 23: Deprogramming

The bus was fixed.

The transmission parts had arrived three days ago, been installed two days ago, tested and ready yesterday. The Greyhound to El Paso sat at the station, engine idling, waiting for passengers.

Ruth stood at the motel window looking at it. They could leave. Should leave. Get back to their lives, their jobs, their normal existences.

Instead, they'd stayed.

The town needed help. The survivors needed help. And somehow, without discussing it, all five of them had decided they couldn't just leave yet.

The high school gymnasium had been converted into a temporary crisis center. Mental health professionals from Dallas and Austin had arrived—cult deprogramming specialists, trauma counselors, psychiatrists. They'd set up stations with cots, counseling areas, medical evaluation spaces.

Ruth walked there mid-morning, three days after the final service. The gymnasium was full. Not just the twenty bunker survivors, but dozens of congregation members seeking help. People realizing they'd been drugged, manipulated, nearly killed.

Shauna was in the medical evaluation area, assisting the psychiatrists. Her ER training translated well—she was efficient, professional, good at asking the right questions. Ruth watched her take a middle-aged woman's vitals, ask about symptoms, document everything with careful precision.

The woman was explaining: "I felt different at the services. Lighter, somehow. Like God was really there. But now... now I just feel stupid. How did I not know?"

"The drugs made you suggestible," Shauna said gently. "It's not your fault. You were chemically manipulated."

"But I chose to go. I chose to drink the wine."

"You chose based on altered brain chemistry. That's not really choice."

Ruth moved on. In the counseling area, Dale sat with a teenage boy—one of the bunker prisoners. They were talking quietly, Dale's seminary training finally useful in the way he'd always hoped.

"I believed him," the boy said. "I thought I was chosen. Special. That God wanted me specifically."

"You are special," Dale said. "But not because a cult leader said so. You're special because you're a person with value and agency and a future. Elijah took that future and tried to twist it into his delusion. But you're still here. You survived."

"Why did God let this happen?"

Ruth saw Dale pause, gathering his thoughts. "I don't know. I honestly don't. Maybe God didn't let it happen—maybe people's free will let it happen. Maybe mental illness let it happen. Maybe something darker let it happen. Or maybe God working through fallible people stopped it from being worse. I don't have answers. I just have questions too."

The honesty seemed to help the boy more than platitudes would have.

Ruth continued through the gymnasium. Levon was helping set up more cots—physical labor, the kind he was good at. A woman approached him hesitantly.

"You're one of the people who saved us," she said.

Levon looked uncomfortable. "Just did what needed doing."

"My daughter was in that bunker. If you hadn't..." The woman's voice broke. "Thank you. I know you probably don't want thanks, but thank you."

Levon nodded, throat working. "She okay?"

"Getting there. Slowly." The woman wiped her eyes. "Are you staying? To help?"

"For a bit. Then I gotta get back to Dallas. Parole check-in."

"You're on parole?"

Ruth saw Levon tense, waiting for the judgment, the fear, the rejection. But the woman just nodded.

"Whatever you did before, you did good here. That's what matters now."

Levon's expression softened. "Thanks. That... thanks."

Ruth found Kimmy in the art therapy area—not as a patient, but as a volunteer. She was showing a young girl how to draw, using her sketchbook to demonstrate. The girl was maybe twelve, daughter of one of the bunker prisoners, traumatized by nearly losing her mother.

"You just draw what you feel," Kimmy was saying. "It doesn't have to be pretty. It just has to be true."

The girl drew dark scribbles, harsh lines, a stick figure surrounded by sharp edges. Kimmy nodded. "That's good. That's real. Now draw something you wish was there."

The girl hesitated, then drew a small flower beside the stick figure.

"Perfect," Kimmy said softly.

Ruth's heart ached watching them. Three weeks ago, Kimmy had been the traumatized runaway. Now she was helping someone else through trauma. Healing by helping.

At noon, Ruth attended the main briefing. Dr. Chen, the lead psychiatrist from Dallas, stood at a folding table with charts and notes spread before him.

"We're seeing consistent patterns," Chen said to the assembled counselors and volunteers. "The congregation members show symptoms of benzodiazepine dependency—mild, since exposure was weekly, but present. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and heightened emotional reactivity."

He flipped a chart. "The bunker prisoners are more severe. Extended exposure to sedatives, combined with sensory manipulation, sleep deprivation, and targeted psychological pressure. Classic cult indoctrination techniques amplified by pharmaceutical manipulation."

"How long for recovery?" one counselor asked.

"Months, minimum. Years for full psychological recovery. Some may never fully trust authority figures again. Some may struggle with faith and spirituality permanently. And then there's the shared delusion component."

Ruth leaned forward. "Shared delusion?"

Chen nodded. "Multiple survivors describe seeing the same entity—a tall white figure with elongated limbs. They describe it independently, with consistent details. Normally I'd attribute this to suggestion, but..." He paused, looking uncomfortable. "The consistency is unusual. Even for group hallucination."

"What's your explanation?" Shauna asked. She'd joined the briefing, still in her blood-stained shirt from three days ago.

"Several possibilities. One: Elijah Caine described his visions to early followers, who incorporated them into their own drug-induced hallucinations, which spread through social influence. Two: The benzodiazepines combined with environmental cues—lighting, music, architecture—created similar visual distortions in multiple people. Three: There was an actual person in costume creating the effect intentionally."

"You don't believe option three," Ruth said.

"No security footage shows anyone, no one admits to dressing up, and the figure was reportedly seen in multiple locations simultaneously. So no, probably not option three." Chen set down his notes. "Most likely, it's option one combined with option two. Shared suggestion plus shared pharmacology equals shared hallucination."

"Most likely," Dale echoed from where he sat. "But not certainly."

Chen looked at him sharply. "Do you have evidence for another explanation?"

"No. Just... uncertainty."

"Certainty is overrated in this field," Chen said wryly. "What matters is treatment works regardless of etiology. We're deprogramming belief, treating withdrawal, and providing trauma counseling. Results so far are positive."

Ruth listened as Chen detailed the treatment plans, the prognoses, the support systems being established. Professional, thorough, rational.

But she couldn't shake the memory of Elijah's journal. *IT's not God. IT feeds on belief and death.*

That afternoon, Ruth sat with one of the original seven missing people—a woman named Patricia, mid-forties, who'd lost three weeks to the bunker.

"I remember choosing to go," Patricia said. "Elijah asked for volunteers for special prayer. I felt so honored. So chosen. I walked into that tent willingly."

"Then what?"

"Wine. He gave me wine, said it would prepare me. I drank it. After that..." Patricia frowned. "It's blurry. I remember the bunker. Prayers playing on speakers constantly. Fasting. Elijah visiting, telling us we were blessed. I believed him. It felt real."

"Do you remember seeing anything unusual? The tall figure other survivors mention?"

Patricia's expression changed. "The angel."

"Angel?"

"That's what Elijah called it. Said it appeared to confirm we were chosen. I saw it... I think. Tall. White. Standing in the shadows of the bunker. Its face wasn't right, but Elijah said divine beings look strange to human eyes." She paused. "Was it real?"

"I don't know," Ruth admitted. "Others saw it too. But that might be shared hallucination from the drugs."

"Or it might have been real."

"Patricia—"

"I know what you think. What the doctors think. Mental illness, drugs, manipulation. And maybe you're right. Probably you're right." Patricia looked at her hands. "But I saw it. And it wasn't kind. It wasn't loving. Even drugged, even indoctrinated, some part of me knew it was wrong. I was terrified of it. But Elijah said fear was normal, that divine presence overwhelms humans."

She met Ruth's eyes. "If it was real, if something really was there... what was it?"

Ruth had no answer.

Evening came. The crisis center began winding down for the night. Survivors returned to temporary housing or hospital beds. Counselors left for hotels. The gymnasium grew quiet.

The five of them sat outside on the bleachers, watching the sun set over the desert. The revival tent was gone—dismantled yesterday, canvas trucked away, stage destroyed. The bunker entrance had been sealed with concrete.

Only the empty field remained.

"They're going to recover," Shauna said. "Medically, psychologically. Give them time and treatment, they'll be okay."

"Most of them," Dale corrected. "Some won't. Some will carry this forever."

"But they're alive," Levon said. "That's what matters. They're alive to have the chance."

Kimmy leaned against Ruth. "Do you think the doctors are right? About the hallucination?"

Ruth considered. "I think shared hallucination explains most of it. Drugs, suggestion, environment. That's the rational answer."

"But?"

"But I also think some questions don't have clean answers. And maybe that's okay. Maybe we don't need to know for certain whether something was there or not. We just need to know we stopped people from dying. That's enough."

"Is it?" Dale asked quietly. "If something really was there, if something really spoke to Elijah and twisted him... it's still out there. Finding someone new."

"Then we watch for it," Ruth said. "We recognize the signs. We speak up when we see manipulation and danger. That's all we can do."

Silence settled. The desert cooled as the sun dipped below the horizon. Somewhere, a coyote howled.

"I don't want to forget this," Kimmy said softly. "What we did here. What it felt like to matter. To save people."

"We won't forget," Ruth promised.

And sitting there on those bleachers, five strangers who'd become family, Ruth believed it.

They'd carry this with them. The fear, the triumph, the uncertainty, the lives saved.

And maybe, if they were lucky, the knowledge that ordinary people could stand against darkness—whatever form that darkness took.

Real or imagined, human or other, it didn't matter.

They'd stood against it.

And they'd won.
