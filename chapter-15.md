# Chapter 15: Kimmy's Danger

Kimmy told herself she was just observing.

The afternoon service started at two. The group thought she was at the motel, sketching. But Kimmy had walked to the tent alone, slipped into the back row, sat small and invisible.

Just observing. Reporting back. Helping.

But when Elijah took the stage, when that voice filled the tent, Kimmy felt something inside her crack open.

"Brothers and sisters, beloved children—so many of you carry pain. I see it in your eyes. The wounds you hide. The families that failed you. The world that told you you're not enough."

Kimmy's throat tightened.

"But here—here you are seen. Here you are loved. Here you are family."

The congregation swayed. Hundreds of people, all moving together. Kimmy found herself swaying too.

"Some of you have been searching your whole lives for home. For a place where you belong. Where you're never alone. Where you're chosen."

Kimmy's eyes burned. When had she started crying?

"Sunday we begin the final journey. Together. As one family. Forever. No more pain. No more fear. Just peace. Just love. Just ascension."

The word ascension hung in the air like a promise.

Kimmy thought about her stepfather's hands. Her mother's silence. The Greyhound stations and truck stops. The nights she'd slept in bathrooms because nowhere else was safe.

What if she never had to run again?

What if she finally belonged?

The service went on forever and ended too soon. Singing. Preaching. Communion that Kimmy didn't take—Ruth had warned her. But everyone around her drank, faces ecstatic, tears streaming.

When it ended, people dispersed slowly. Kimmy stood to leave.

Elijah was there. Right in front of her.

"Kimmy. Sweet child. Will you stay for a moment?"

His voice was so gentle. His eyes so blue.

She nodded.

He gestured to chairs near the stage. They sat. Elijah took both her hands. His hands were warm. Strong. Safe.

"I've been watching you," he said softly. "Since the first day you arrived. I see you, Kimmy. The real you. The hurt you."

"I don't know what you mean," she whispered.

"Yes, you do." His thumbs rubbed circles on her hands. "You're running from someone. The man who hurt you. The mother who should have protected you but didn't."

Kimmy's breath stopped. How did he know?

"Your stepfather," Elijah continued. "He hurt you. For years. Your mother looked away. Chose him over you."

Tears streamed down Kimmy's face. She'd never told anyone the details. Ruth knew she was running. The others knew she'd been hurt. But the specifics—she'd never spoken them aloud.

"How do you know?" she managed.

"God shows me," Elijah said simply. "He tells me who needs His love most. And you, precious child, need so much love."

She was sobbing now. Full body sobs. And Elijah pulled her into a hug, held her while she cried. His arms felt like safety. Like the father she'd never had. Like protection.

"You don't have to run anymore," he murmured. "You can stay here. Be part of our family. Forever."

"Forever?"

"Sunday. The Final Ascension. I'm inviting you specially. You're one of the chosen. One of the pure. You'll receive a special blessing. And you'll never, ever be alone again."

Kimmy pulled back, looked at his face. He was smiling. Kind. Understanding.

"What happens at the Final Ascension?" she asked.

"Transformation. We leave our earthly bodies behind. All the pain, all the fear—gone. We ascend together as one family to heaven. Where there's no more suffering. Just peace. Just love."

It sounded beautiful. Like everything she'd ever wanted.

"Will it hurt?" she whispered.

"Like falling asleep. Waking up in paradise. I'll be there with you. You won't be afraid."

Kimmy felt herself nodding. Yes. Yes, she wanted that. Wanted to stop running. Wanted to belong. Wanted family that would never abandon her.

"Sunday evening, seven PM," Elijah said. "Come early. I'll have a special place for you near the front. You'll take communion first. Receive the blessing first. Be among the first to ascend."

"Okay," Kimmy heard herself say. "I'll—"

And then Ruth's face flashed in her mind.

Ruth at the diner, making sure she ate. Ruth giving her money for clothes without shame. Ruth's awkward hug, uncomfortable with mothering but trying.

Dale's gentle voice. Not talking down. Treating her like she mattered.

Shauna's protective edge. Stepping between her and Elijah that first day.

Levon teaching her poker. His genuine smile when she beat him.

Her sketchbook drawing of them as heroes. Together.

Family.

She already had family.

"I'll think about it," Kimmy said suddenly.

Elijah's expression shifted. Just for a second. Something cold flickering behind the warmth. Then his smile returned.

"Of course. Think and pray. But don't wait too long. The time is soon. I would hate for you to miss your blessing."

"I won't. I mean, I'll... I'll let you know."

She stood. Elijah stood too, still holding her hands.

"God brought you to me for a reason, Kimmy. Don't run from His plan."

"I won't."

She pulled her hands free. Walked toward the exit. Not running. Not yet.

Outside the tent, fifty yards away, she ran.

Canvas sneakers slapping dirt. Tears blurring her vision. Running like she'd run a thousand times before. But this time not from danger—from safety that felt like death.

She reached the motel. Ruth's room. Knocked frantically.

The door opened. Ruth stood there, concern immediate.

"Kimmy? What's wrong?"

"I almost—I almost—"

She broke down crying. Ruth pulled her inside, awkward arms wrapping around her. Not motherly. Ruth didn't know how to be motherly. But trying.

The others were there. Dale at the table. Shauna organizing supplies. Levon with his lockpicks.

They stared.

"What happened?" Shauna asked, crossing to them.

Kimmy couldn't speak. Just cried into Ruth's shoulder while Ruth held her and made small soothing sounds that sounded more like scientific observation than comfort but somehow helped anyway.

Finally, Kimmy found words.

"I went to the service. I was just watching. But Elijah talked to me after. He knew things. About my stepfather. About my mom. Things I never told anyone."

Ruth guided her to the bed. They sat. The others gathered close.

"What did he say?" Dale asked gently.

"He knew my stepfather hurt me. That my mom didn't protect me. He described it like he saw it." Kimmy's voice shook. "He said I didn't have to run anymore. That I could belong here. Forever."

"What else?" Shauna pressed.

"He invited me to Sunday's ceremony. Said I'm chosen. Special blessing. First to ascend. He made it sound beautiful. Peaceful."

Silence.

"And you almost said yes," Ruth said quietly.

Kimmy nodded, shame burning. "I wanted to. So badly. To stop running. To belong. I was nodding. Then I thought about you. All of you. I realized I'm not alone. I already have family."

Ruth's arms tightened around her. When Kimmy looked up, Ruth's eyes were damp.

"How did he know those details?" Levon asked. "About your stepfather. About your mother."

"I don't know. He said God told him."

"Cold reading," Dale said. "Looking at you, making educated guesses. Runaway teenager, trauma markers. He guessed abuse and you filled in the specifics."

"But he was so specific," Kimmy said. "He didn't guess. He knew."

"Someone in town might have told him," Shauna offered. "If you mentioned it to the diner waitress or the motel clerk. They're all under his influence. They could have reported back."

"I didn't tell anyone," Kimmy said. "Not the details."

They sat with that. The mystery of how Elijah knew. The implication that his manipulation was even more sophisticated than they'd realized.

"Doesn't matter how," Levon said finally. "What matters is he's recruiting her. Actively. Targeting the most vulnerable of us."

"He wants me at the ceremony Sunday," Kimmy said. "He said I'd take communion first. Be among the first to ascend."

Shauna's face went pale. "The first to drink the poison."

"He's using you," Ruth said, voice hard. "Young, alone, vulnerable. Perfect target. If he gets you to volunteer publicly—take communion first and die in front of everyone—it validates his narrative. The young, pure girl ascending first."

"I won't go," Kimmy said quickly. "I'm not going."

"He'll come for you again," Dale said. "He won't let a target walk away."

"Then we don't let her out of our sight," Levon said. "One of us with her at all times."

Ruth looked at each of them. Kimmy saw something shift in her expression. Teacher to mama bear.

"We act tomorrow," Ruth said. "No more waiting. No more planning. Elijah just recruited a sixteen-year-old girl for mass suicide. We stop him. Now."

"Tomorrow's Saturday," Dale said. "One day before the Final Ascension."

"Then we have one day to save 144 lives." Ruth's jaw set. "Dale, you confront Elijah at tomorrow evening's service. Public theological challenge. Break his authority before Sunday."

"I'll be ready."

"Shauna, you prepare medical exposure. If Dale's challenge fails, you reveal the drugging."

"I have everything I need."

"Levon, bunker evacuation. Sunday morning before the final ceremony, we get those twenty people out."

"I can do it. But I'll need help."

"You'll have it. All of us." Ruth looked at Kimmy. "You stay with me. Never alone. Never in danger."

Kimmy felt tears again. But different tears. Not pain. Gratitude.

"He said I was chosen," she said quietly. "That I was special."

"You are chosen," Ruth said firmly. "Chosen by us. To be protected. To be family. To live." She paused. "Real family doesn't ask you to die for them. Real family keeps you alive."

Kimmy thought about that. About Elijah's promises of eternal family. About belonging forever. About never being alone again.

All true. If you were dead.

But Ruth's promise—protection, life, family that kept you breathing—that was real.

"What do I do tomorrow?" Kimmy asked.

"You stay here. Safe. You sketch, you rest, you wait. And when we stop Elijah, you'll be the first person we tell."

Kimmy nodded. She pulled out her sketchbook, flipped to her drawing of the five of them as heroes.

"I'm going to redraw this," she said. "When it's over. When everyone's safe. I'll draw us again. But better. Bigger. Real heroes."

Dale smiled. "We're not heroes. We're just people trying to do the right thing."

"That's what heroes are," Kimmy said.

Outside, evening settled over Crossroads. One more day until Saturday's confrontation. Two until Sunday's Final Ascension.

But inside Ruth's motel room, five people sat together. Strangers who'd become family. Not through promises of eternity. Through protection. Choice. Care.

Kimmy looked at her drawing. Ruth's determined face. Dale's gentle eyes. Shauna's protective stance. Levon's rough competence.

Her family. The one that wanted her to live.

Tomorrow they'd fight for 144 lives. But tonight, they'd already saved one.

Hers.
