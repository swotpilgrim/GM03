# Chapter 29: Letters and Calls

Months passed. Summer became fall, fall became winter. 1980 slipped toward 1981.

The group stayed in touch—letters mostly, occasional long-distance phone calls when someone had quarters for the payphone or felt the expense was worth it.

Levon sent the first correspondence in September: a postcard from Dallas showing the skyline at sunset. His handwriting was careful, blocky, like someone who hadn't written much.

*Ruth—*

*Construction job's going good. Foreman says I'm reliable. Funny word for an ex-con. Parole's done official now. Free for the first time in nine years. Don't know what to do with that yet.*

*Found an AA meeting near my apartment. Not for drinking (never had a problem with that) but the sponsor said structure helps. He's right. Go three times a week. Met some good people.*

*Hope El Paso's treating you right. Tell Kimmy I said hi.*

*-Levon*

Ruth had pinned it to her refrigerator. Simple, honest, hopeful.

Shauna called from Houston in October. Late night—Ruth was grading papers when the phone rang.

"Just finished a double shift," Shauna said without preamble. "Sixteen hours. Gunshot wound, three overdoses, one cardiac arrest, and a drunk driver who coded twice. We saved them all."

"That's good," Ruth said.

"Yeah." Shauna was quiet for a moment. "I thought about Texas today. About the bunker. How close those twenty people came to dying. And I realized—that's what I do every shift. Pull people back from dying. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But Texas was the first time I saved multiple lives in one night."

"You do important work."

"So do you. Teaching fifth graders might not feel dramatic, but you're shaping who they become. That matters." Shauna's voice softened slightly. "How's Kimmy?"

"Thriving. Straight As first semester. Joined the art club and the school newspaper. The Hendersons are good for her."

"Good. She deserves good." A pause. "Do you think about it? The case?"

"Sometimes. You?"

"More than I want to admit." Shauna sighed. "I keep telling myself it was mental illness. Drugs. Manipulation. All explainable. But I dream about that tent sometimes. About the figure people described. About Elijah talking to empty air."

"Do you think it was real?"

"No. Yes. I don't know." Frustration bled through Shauna's usual professional calm. "Medical training says no. But I can't explain the consistency of the visions, the photographs, the... feeling. That tent felt wrong, Ruth. Even before we knew what was happening, it felt wrong."

"Intuition," Ruth offered. "Subconscious pattern recognition."

"Probably. Or maybe some things don't have rational explanations, and I need to make peace with that." Shauna laughed without humor. "Never thought I'd say that."

They talked a while longer—normal life, work stories, plans for Christmas. But the conversation circled back to Texas, like it always did. The case that had changed them.

After hanging up, Ruth sat at her kitchen table with Shauna's words echoing: *Some things don't have rational explanations.*

Dale's letters came monthly, long and philosophical. November's arrived on cream stationery, his neat handwriting filling both sides.

*Dear Ruth,*

*I'm auditing theology classes again at Dallas Theological Seminary—not enrolled, just sitting in lectures. The professors remember me, still disappointed I left. One asked if I was reconsidering ordination. I told him I was reconsidering what ordained ministry means.*

*Texas changed how I see faith. I used to think belief required certainty. But now I think the opposite—real faith is believing despite uncertainty. Trusting despite unanswered questions. Moving forward without all the answers.*

*I'm also working with a cult recovery nonprofit. Volunteer counselor for people leaving high-control groups. I tell them about Elijah, about the twenty people we saved, about recognizing manipulation. It feels like my calling, though not the one I expected.*

*One survivor asked me: "Do you think demons are real?" I didn't know how to answer. Seminary taught me specific doctrine—fallen angels, spiritual warfare, clear categories. But after Texas, I don't know. Maybe demons are real. Maybe they're metaphors for mental illness and evil human choices. Maybe both are true somehow.*

*I told her the truth: "I don't know, but I know manipulation is real. Control is real. Abuse is real. And you can survive those regardless of their source."*

*She seemed satisfied with that. Maybe uncertainty with honesty is better than certainty without truth.*

*How are you? How's teaching? Have you heard from the others?*

*Your friend,
Dale*

Ruth replied to all his letters. She found Dale's philosophical wrestling comforting—someone else grappling with the same questions, finding no easy answers but continuing anyway.

December brought Kimmy's first report card as Ruth's... what? Foster daughter? Mentee? Found family?

Kimmy brought it over during Sunday dinner—their tradition now, every week without fail. Kimmy arrived at five, they cooked together, ate, talked, and Kimmy went home by nine. Routine. Stability. The structure trauma survivors needed.

"All As," Kimmy announced proudly. "Even geometry, which I hate."

"That's wonderful." Ruth examined the card. Teacher comments: *Kimmy is a thoughtful, creative student who contributes meaningfully to class discussions. A pleasure to teach.*

"Mrs. Henderson says I should apply to college," Kimmy said. "Like, actual four-year university. She thinks I could get scholarships."

"You absolutely could."

"I never thought..." Kimmy's voice caught. "Six months ago I was living in bus stations. Now I'm thinking about college. How did that happen?"

"You made different choices. Harder choices. You chose to leave abuse. You chose to walk away from Elijah when he offered you exactly what you wanted. You chose to accept help. That's all you."

"But you helped."

"We helped each other. That's how it works." Ruth served the spaghetti she'd made. "Have you talked to the others lately?"

"Dale called last week. We talked for an hour about theology and art and whether beauty proves God exists. He's weird but I like him." Kimmy grinned. "Levon sent me a birthday card. Had a twenty dollar bill inside and a note that said 'Buy something stupid.' So I bought comic books and candy."

"Very stupid."

"Exactly." Kimmy's smile faded slightly. "Do you think we'll stay in touch? Long term? Or will this fade and we'll forget each other?"

"We'll stay in touch. What we went through—that bonds people permanently. You don't forget the people you saved lives with."

"I hope you're right."

Christmas Eve. Ruth's phone rang at eight PM. Conference call—Dale had figured out how to patch multiple lines through the seminary's phone system.

"Everyone there?" Dale asked.

"I'm here," Ruth said.

"Houston present," Shauna confirmed.

"Dallas checking in," Levon said.

"El Paso!" Kimmy shouted, giddy with the technology.

They talked for two hours. Levon described his first real Christmas in years—invited to his AA sponsor's family dinner. Shauna detailed her emergency room Christmas shift (scheduled to avoid family obligations back home she still avoided). Dale explained his sister's attempts to set him up with "a nice Christian girl from church."

Ruth described Kimmy's progress, her own classroom, the satisfaction of teaching.

And eventually, inevitably, the conversation turned to Oklahoma.

"Anyone see the news?" Dale asked carefully.

Silence. Then Ruth said, "Yes."

Another revival preacher. Another small town. Suspicious deaths ruled accidental. Pattern emerging. Then last week—preacher died in a single-car accident. Drove off a bridge, alone in the car. Witnesses said he was swerving to avoid something in the road.

Nothing was in the road.

"Same pattern as Elijah," Shauna said quietly.

"Exactly the same," Dale confirmed. "I called the FBI cult division. Sent them everything about Elijah—timeline, methods, the pattern. Told them to watch for it."

"Will they?" Levon asked.

"They said they'd investigate. But unless someone steps forward like we did..." Dale's frustration was evident.

"We can't investigate every cult in America," Ruth said. "We're not vigilantes."

"But we know the signs," Kimmy countered. "We know what to look for. Shouldn't we do something?"

"We did do something," Shauna said firmly. "We saved four hundred people. We documented everything for law enforcement. We're living our lives and watching for patterns. That's enough."

"Is it?" Dale pressed.

"Yes," Ruth said with certainty. "Because the alternative is obsession. Chasing shadows. Seeing cults everywhere. We trust the authorities, we stay alert, but we don't sacrifice our lives to this."

Silence on the line. Then Levon: "Ruth's right. We did our part. Now we live. That's how you honor what we went through—by building good lives with what we learned."

"Okay," Dale said finally. "You're right. I just... I hate feeling powerless."

"You're not powerless. You're helping cult survivors every day. That's huge." Ruth softened her voice. "We all are, in our own ways. Teaching, healing, building, creating. That's fighting the darkness—one choice at a time."

The conversation shifted to lighter topics after that. Plans for the new year. Hopes and goals. Normal life.

But before they hung up, Dale said: "If it happens again—if we see the pattern somewhere nearby—do we act?"

Ruth considered. "If we can help, yes. But together. Not alone. We decide together."

"Deal," Levon said.

"Deal," Shauna echoed.

"Deal," Kimmy agreed.

They said their goodbyes. Merry Christmas. Stay safe. Talk soon.

Ruth hung up and sat in her quiet apartment. Outside, El Paso sparkled with Christmas lights. Inside, warmth and safety and normal life.

But in her desk drawer, the photograph waited. Mystery preserved. Questions unanswered.

And somewhere in America, someone else might be hearing voices, mistaking madness for divinity, walking the same path Elijah had walked.

Ruth couldn't stop that. None of them could.

But they could watch. They could recognize the pattern. They could speak up if it came close.

That would have to be enough.

For now, it was.
