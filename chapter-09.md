# Chapter 9: Shauna's Evidence

Shauna had stolen plenty of things from the ER. Medications for patients who couldn't afford them. Bandages for the homeless. Lab results that would have gotten people fired.

This was the first time she'd stolen communion wine.

The morning service was smaller—maybe three hundred people. Shauna sat in the back row, medical kit in her purse, camera under her jacket. Ruth sat beside her, notebook ready. Kimmy was at the motel with Dale.

The service followed the same pattern. Singing, preaching, healings. Elijah's voice washing over the congregation like waves. Shauna watched faces transform—skeptical to entranced, worried to ecstatic.

Then came communion.

Elijah blessed the wine and bread with theatrical reverence. "The blood of Christ, given for you. The body of Christ, broken for you. Take and remember the sacrifice that saves us."

Volunteers distributed small plastic cups filled with red wine. Shauna accepted hers, bowed her head like everyone else. The congregation drank in unison.

Shauna brought the cup to her lips, tilted it, but didn't swallow. She let the wine touch her tongue—sweet, with a chemical aftertaste she recognized instantly. Benzodiazepines had that distinctive bitter note.

When heads were still bowed in prayer, Shauna slipped the cup into a plastic evidence bag in her purse. Sealed it. One hand stayed on her purse, protecting the sample.

Ruth caught her eye, raised an eyebrow. Shauna gave a small nod. *Got it.*

The service continued for another hour. More preaching about the 144,000, about the tribulation. Shauna tuned it out, analyzing what she'd tasted.

Benzodiazepines. Probably diazepam or lorazepam—common, cheap, effective. Low dose, not enough to cause obvious intoxication. But repeated doses through communion would build cumulative effects. Drowsiness. Suggestibility. Memory impairment. Dependency.

That's how Elijah controlled the town. Not just psychological manipulation—chemical assistance.

The service ended. Shauna and Ruth left with the crowd, walking quickly back to the motel.

In her room, Shauna spread medical supplies across the bed. Field testing kit—basic but functional. Chemical strips that changed color based on substance detected.

Ruth watched from the chair. "What exactly are you testing for?"

"Sedatives. Benzodiazepines—drugs like Valium, Ativan. Prescribed for anxiety, but in low repeated doses they create dependency and suggestibility." Shauna transferred wine to a testing vial. "If Elijah's drugging the communion wine, this will show it."

She added the chemical reagent. The liquid turned pale blue instantly.

"That's positive," Shauna said quietly.

Ruth leaned forward. "You're sure?"

"Positive for benzodiazepines. Can't tell which drug or exact dosage without a lab, but this confirms sedatives in the communion wine." Shauna labeled the evidence bag. "Everyone who takes communion is being drugged without consent."

"That's illegal."

"Felony assault in most states." Shauna sealed the tested sample. "But this alone might not convince authorities. We need more documentation."

"What do you need?"

"Someone who's been regularly taking communion. Document the physical symptoms. Photographs, written observations."

Ruth stood. "The diner. There's always congregation members there. You can approach someone under a pretext."

Shauna grabbed her camera—110 film, same kind Dale had used. She loaded a fresh roll, tucked it in her purse with notebook and medical supplies.

They walked to the diner through afternoon heat. Inside, Shauna scanned the room.

There—a woman in her forties, sitting alone at the counter. Shauna recognized her from the service. She'd been one of the first to take communion.

"Wish me luck," Shauna murmured to Ruth.

She approached the counter, sliding onto the stool beside the woman. The waitress—same dreamy smile—took Shauna's order. Coffee, black.

Shauna turned to the woman. "Excuse me. I'm conducting a community health survey for a research project. Would you mind answering a few questions? It's completely voluntary and anonymous."

The woman blinked slowly. Her pupils were dilated despite the bright diner lights. "A survey?"

"Just about general health and wellness in small towns. It'll only take a few minutes."

"I suppose that's fine."

Shauna pulled out her notebook, clicked her pen. Professional, clinical. "What's your name?"

"Linda. Linda Parker."

"Thank you, Linda. How long have you lived in Crossroads?"

"My whole life. Forty-three years."

Shauna made notes. "And how would you describe your general health?"

Linda smiled that beatific smile. "Better than ever. Brother Caine healed me two weeks ago. I had migraines for years. They're gone now."

"That's wonderful. What kind of treatment did he provide?"

"Prayer. He laid hands on me and prayed. The migraines vanished immediately."

Shauna wrote carefully. *Subject reports immediate healing via prayer. Claims long-term migraines resolved. Evaluate for pharmaceutical influence vs genuine improvement.*

"Do you take any medications currently?"

Linda thought for a moment—the pause longer than it should be. "No. I don't think so. I used to take something for the headaches. Can't remember the name. But I don't need it anymore."

Memory impairment. Classic benzodiazepine effect.

"May I check your pupils? Just routine health screening."

Linda agreed easily. Shauna pulled out her penlight, shone it in Linda's eyes. Pupils dilated 5mm, sluggish reaction to light. She had Linda follow the light with her eyes—smooth pursuit, but delayed. She checked Linda's hands—slight tremor, subtle ataxia.

"How do you feel right now?" Shauna asked.

"Peaceful. Like I'm floating. Everything's so clear now. Brother Caine showed me the truth."

"The truth about what?"

"About the end times. About being chosen. About ascension." Linda's eyes were distant, dreamy. "I'm one of the 144,000. When the tribulation comes, I'll be saved."

Shauna felt cold. "When do you think that will happen?"

"Soon. Maybe weeks. Maybe days. We're preparing. Taking communion every service." Linda smiled. "Are you attending services? You should. Brother Caine could help you too."

"I've been to a few," Shauna said carefully. "What happens during communion? How does it make you feel?"

"Holy. Blessed. The wine tastes sweet, like grace. After I take it, everything feels lighter. My worries disappear. I just feel... loved."

Chemical dependency presenting as spiritual experience. Shauna's anger built, cold and sharp.

"Linda, can I take your photograph? For the survey records."

Linda nodded. Shauna positioned her near the window, natural light illuminating her face. The camera clicked. Evidence—dilated pupils, dreamy expression, the physical markers of pharmaceutical manipulation.

"Thank you so much for your time," Shauna said, tucking the camera away.

"Of course. You should come to evening service tonight. Seven o'clock. Brother Caine gives special blessings."

"I'll consider it."

Shauna returned to Ruth's booth, hands shaking.

Ruth poured coffee. "Well?"

"Textbook benzodiazepine intoxication. Dilated pupils, delayed responses, memory impairment, false euphoria." Shauna pulled out her notebook, writing rapidly. "She thinks her migraines were healed by prayer. More likely, the sedatives mask the pain. She's chemically dependent and doesn't know it."

"Will the photographs show it?"

"The pupils will. Combined with my medical documentation and the tested wine sample, this is solid evidence." Shauna's pen pressed hard on paper. "He's drugging hundreds of people without consent. Creating chemical dependency disguised as spiritual experience."

Ruth watched her. "This makes you angry."

Shauna looked up. "Yes."

"Why? I mean, I know it's wrong. But you seem personally angry."

Shauna was quiet. She didn't talk about her marriage. The years of being told her reality wasn't real, that her memory was wrong.

"My ex-husband was a cop," she said finally. "When I tried to leave, he convinced everyone I was unstable. Made me doubt my own mind."

Ruth's expression softened. "I'm sorry."

"Elijah's doing the same thing. Making them think their drugged state is divine blessing. Making them doubt reality. They can't consent because they don't even know what's happening." Shauna's jaw tightened. "It's sophisticated, systematic abuse."

"Can we prosecute him for this?"

"We can try. Drugging someone without consent is felony assault in Texas. But—"

The diner door opened. Levon walked in, spotted them, crossed over. He slid into the booth.

"Got something," Shauna said. She showed him the evidence bag with the wine sample, her test results, her medical documentation of Linda.

Levon examined the materials carefully. His expression darkened.

"This is drugging without consent. Felony assault, maybe more depending on how many people he's dosed." He looked at Shauna. "This is prosecutable."

"But is it enough?" Ruth asked. "Will authorities act on this alone?"

Levon was quiet, thinking. "Maybe. If we take this to state police or DEA, they might investigate. But..."

"But seven people are still missing," Shauna finished. "And if Elijah gets wind of an investigation before we find them, he could kill them. Cover his tracks."

"Exactly."

Ruth made notes in her spiral notebook. "So we have evidence of pharmaceutical manipulation. Dale has evidence of nine deaths in three states and the bunker location. But we don't have the missing seven people."

"Which means we need to find them," Levon said. "Before we can involve authorities."

Dale appeared in the entrance, briefcase in hand. He saw them and hurried over.

"I've been looking for you. What did you find?"

Shauna showed him her evidence. Explained the testing, Linda's examination, the benzodiazepines.

Dale paled. "He's drugging them. All of them."

"Everyone who takes communion. Multiple times per week."

"That explains the town-wide compliance. Not just psychological manipulation—physical dependency." Dale sat heavily. "This is worse than I thought."

"It's systematic," Ruth said. "The drugs create suggestibility. The preaching creates belief. The missing people are 'ascended.' He's built a perfect system of control."

Levon looked at each of them. "So what's our next move?"

Shauna organized her evidence—wine sample, test results, photographs, medical documentation. "We have proof of felony assault. Dale has proof of historical pattern and bunker location. But we still need to find those seven people."

"The bunker," Dale said. "They have to be in the bunker. That's the only place that makes sense."

"Then we go in," Levon said flatly. "Find them. Document it. Then we have everything we need for authorities."

Ruth was quiet, thinking. Then she nodded. "Tomorrow night. During the evening service when Elijah's occupied."

"I can pick the lock on the prayer tent," Levon said. "Get us access to the underground entrance."

"I'll document everything medically," Shauna added. "If those people are imprisoned and drugged, I can evaluate their condition."

"I'll photograph everything," Dale said. "Evidence they can't ignore."

They sat in the diner booth, five strangers who'd become a team. Outside, afternoon sun angled toward evening. Somewhere underground, seven people waited.

Tomorrow night, they'd find them.

Shauna looked at her evidence bag, the communion wine that had poisoned hundreds. Linda's dreamy smile, her false memories, her absolute certainty that Elijah had saved her.

Tomorrow night, they'd expose the truth.

And save those seven people before Elijah could add them to his body count.
