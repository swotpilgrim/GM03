# Chapter 14: The Waiting Game

Morning brought no police cars. No sirens. No rescue.

Ruth stood at the motel window watching the empty parking lot, phone number for state police clutched in her hand. She'd called last night. Filed a report. Explained everything.

No one had come.

At eight AM, she walked to the truck stop payphone and tried again.

"State Police, how may I direct your call?"

"I called last night about a cult situation in Crossroads. Twenty people imprisoned, mass suicide planned for Sunday."

Click. Hold music. Three minutes.

A different operator. "Ma'am, your report was forwarded to local jurisdiction. Crossroads Sheriff's Department has been notified."

"The sheriff won't act. He's compromised or controlled."

"Sheriff Hendricks investigated and determined the situation is voluntary religious activity. No laws being broken."

Ruth's knuckles went white. "Twenty people are being held sedated in an underground bunker. That's kidnapping."

"Sheriff Hendricks found no evidence. He visited the revival grounds. Everything appears in order."

"Did he go into the bunker?"

"The sheriff's report indicates no criminal activity."

"I have photographs. Planning documents. A journal documenting mass murder."

"Obtained how, ma'am?"

Ruth hesitated. "We entered the property—"

"Criminal trespass. Evidence obtained illegally isn't admissible. If you continue harassing local authorities, you could be charged with making false reports."

The line clicked. Dial tone.

Ruth stood there, phone pressed to her ear, rage building like pressure in her chest.

Twenty people drugged and imprisoned. Hundreds more at risk Sunday night. She had proof. Photos. Documents. Testimony.

And not one person with authority cared.

She slammed the receiver down, walked back to the motel. The others were waiting in her room.

"Well?" Dale asked.

"Nothing. Sheriff says he investigated, found nothing wrong. State police defer to his judgment. They threatened to charge me with making false reports if I call again."

Levon swore. "Of course they did. Sheriff's probably taking money from Elijah. Or drinking the drugged communion wine himself."

Shauna sat on the bed, exhausted. "So we're on our own."

"We've been on our own," Ruth said. "I just hoped..." She stopped. No point hoping. The system had failed. Every authority figure, every protective mechanism society supposedly had—failed.

If those twenty people were going to be saved, if hundreds more were going to survive Sunday, it was up to five strangers in a motel room.

"We need a plan," Ruth said. "A real plan. Three days until the Ascension Ceremony. We can't wait anymore."

They gathered around the small table. Dale had his briefcase. Shauna had her medical kit. Levon had his surveillance notes. Kimmy had her sketchbook.

Ruth had her spiral notebook. Empty page. Waiting to be filled with their plan to save 144 lives.

"Options," she said. "What can we actually do?"

Shauna spoke first. "Medical exposure. I document the drugging publicly. Stand up during a service, show the communion wine test results, explain the pharmaceutical manipulation. Break the spell by revealing the mechanism."

"They won't believe you," Dale said. "They're too far gone. Even seeing evidence, they'll rationalize it as persecution or lies from non-believers."

"Some might listen," Shauna insisted. "Not everyone is completely controlled."

"Enough to matter?" Levon asked.

Silence.

Levon leaned forward. "We take Elijah out. Simple. Clean. Cult collapses without its leader."

Ruth felt ice in her stomach. "You mean kill him."

"I mean remove the threat."

"No." Ruth's voice was flat. "We're not murderers."

"He's planning to murder 144 people."

"Then we stop him without becoming like him." Ruth met Levon's eyes. "I won't cross that line. None of us will."

"Even if it saves lives?"

"Even then."

Levon sat back. "Fine. But we're running out of options."

Dale had been quiet, flipping through Elijah's journal. Now he spoke.

"Theological confrontation."

They looked at him.

"Elijah's authority comes from his claim of divine mandate. God speaks to him, commands him. But what if we challenge that using scripture?"

"Explain," Ruth said.

"Elijah believes he's fulfilling biblical prophecy. The 144,000 from Revelation. But that's a misreading. The 144,000 are sealed—marked for protection during tribulation. Not sacrificed. Saved. If I challenge his interpretation publicly, show the congregation he's contradicting scripture, it might break his authority."

"Would that work?" Shauna asked.

"Maybe. Cult leaders need validation. They need followers to believe their divine connection. If I can make the congregation doubt his theological authority—even for a moment—that doubt could spread."

Levon was skeptical. "You want to debate theology while he's poisoning people?"

"I want to break his hold before Sunday. If even some people refuse to attend the ceremony, we save them."

Ruth considered. "It's a long shot."

"Everything's a long shot," Dale said. "But I've been studying his journal. His scripture citations, his interpretations. He's making errors. Fundamental theological errors. Things a seminary student would catch. If I confront him publicly with those errors, in front of his congregation, it might work."

"Or it might just make him angry," Levon said.

"Then we have backup plans," Ruth said. She wrote in her notebook:

PLAN A: Theological confrontation - Dale challenges Elijah publicly, breaks authority
PLAN B: Medical exposure - Shauna reveals drugging at service
PLAN C: Bunker evacuation - Levon leads rescue of twenty imprisoned
PLAN D: Physical disruption of communion - knock over wine, create chaos, evacuate congregation

"We execute all of them," Ruth said. "Parallel approaches. Dale works on theological arguments. Shauna prepares to expose drugging. Levon plans bunker evacuation routes. And I..." She paused. "I document everything for prosecution after this is over. Because even if we save lives, Elijah needs to answer for what he's done."

"Three days," Shauna said. "Can we prepare all that in three days?"

"We have to."

They divided responsibilities. Dale took Elijah's journal, began cross-referencing scripture. Levon left to scout evacuation routes. Shauna went to the pharmacy for medical supplies—activated charcoal, IV fluids, emergency medications.

Ruth stayed at the table with Kimmy.

"What can I do?" Kimmy asked.

"You've been attending services, right?"

Kimmy nodded. "To monitor Elijah."

"Keep going. But carefully. Don't drink the communion wine. Don't get pulled in. Just observe and report."

"He's recruiting heavily," Kimmy said quietly. "For Sunday's ceremony. He calls it the Final Ascension. Says it's the most important service ever. That everyone who attends will be transformed. Saved."

"How many people is he expecting?"

"Hundreds. He's been preaching about it all week. People are excited. Preparing. They think..." Kimmy's voice dropped. "They think Sunday they're going to heaven."

Ruth felt cold. "And they will. Just not the way they think."

The door opened. Shauna returned with a bag of supplies. "Pharmacy had most of what I need. Activated charcoal, IV fluids, naloxone in case there's opiates in the sedation cocktail. I can set up a detox station if we get those twenty people out."

"Will they cooperate?" Ruth asked.

"Not willingly. They're indoctrinated. They'll think we're kidnapping them. But once the sedatives wear off and they can think clearly, they might understand."

"Or they might run straight back to Elijah," Levon said, returning from his scouting. He spread a napkin on the table, rough map drawn in pen. "Bunker has two exits. Main stairs through prayer tent, secondary emergency exit leading to ventilation shaft three hundred yards east. If we evacuate, we use the emergency exit. Less visible."

"Can you get them through an emergency exit?" Ruth asked.

"If they're semiconscious and compliant, yeah. Twenty people—we'd need help. Can't do it alone."

"We all help," Shauna said. "Sunday morning, before the final service. We evacuate the bunker, get them to safety, then disrupt the communion ceremony."

Dale returned at noon, notepad filled with scripture citations and counter-arguments.

"I have it. Fourteen different places where Elijah's theology contradicts scripture. The 144,000. The nature of ascension. The timing of tribulation. If I can corner him in public debate, I can expose the errors."

"He won't debate you," Levon said. "He'll have you thrown out."

"Not if I do it during a service. In front of hundreds of people. He can't ignore that without looking weak."

"He might have you arrested."

"Then you document it. Film it. Show his followers that he silences questions with force, not scripture."

Ruth made notes. Plan A refined: Dale confronts Elijah during Saturday evening service—one day before Final Ascension. Public challenge. If successful, attendance drops for Sunday. If unsuccessful, move to backup plans.

They worked through the afternoon. Refining strategies. Identifying weaknesses. Building contingencies.

By evening, they had something resembling a plan. Fragile. Risky. Maybe impossible.

But it was all they had.

Kimmy went to the evening service to monitor. She returned at ten PM, face frightened.

"Hundreds of people. Maybe four hundred. All excited about Sunday. Elijah preached for two hours about transformation. About leaving earthly bodies. Ascending as one community."

"Did he mention specifics?" Dale asked.

"Sunday evening, seven PM. Final communion. He told everyone to fast beforehand—purify their bodies. And he asked people to bring their families. Children. Everyone."

Ruth felt sick. "Children?"

"He said children are the most pure. Most worthy of ascension."

Shauna made a small sound. "He's planning to poison children."

"How many children?" Ruth asked.

Kimmy's voice shook. "I saw maybe twenty families with kids. Young ones. Five, six years old. Some younger."

The room went silent.

Ruth thought about her students. Twenty years teaching teenagers, protecting them, helping them navigate toward better futures. The idea of someone poisoning children—calling it salvation—made her want to scream.

"We stop this," she said. Voice steady despite the rage. "Whatever it takes. Sunday morning we evacuate the bunker. Sunday evening we disrupt that ceremony. No one drinks that poison. No one dies."

"And if we fail?" Levon asked quietly.

Ruth looked at each of them. Dale with his theology and fear. Shauna with her medical knowledge and trauma. Levon with his criminal skills and redemption. Kimmy with her art and hope.

"We don't fail. Failure isn't an option."

Outside, night settled over Crossroads. Two more days until Sunday.

Two more days until Elijah served poisoned communion to four hundred people including children.

Two more days to save 144 lives with nothing but faith, determination, and a plan that might not work.

Ruth opened her notebook to a fresh page. Began writing the timeline. Hour by hour. Saturday morning through Sunday night.

Every step they'd take.

Every move they'd make.

Every life they'd save.

Because the system had failed.

The authorities had failed.

But they wouldn't fail.

They couldn't.

Too many people were counting on them—even if those people didn't know it yet.

Ruth wrote until her hand cramped, building the plan that would save a town from its own prophet.
