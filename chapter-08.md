# Chapter 8: Dale's Discovery

The library was blessedly empty and cool.

Dale pushed through the glass doors at eight-thirty. The evening service would run until ten, giving him ninety minutes of uninterrupted research.

The librarian—young, wire-rim glasses—looked up. Her eyes had that same glazed quality everyone shared, but she smiled warmly.

"Can I help you?"

"Newspaper archives? Microfilm or microfiche?"

"In the back. I'll show you."

She led him to a cramped room with file cabinets and a single microfilm reader—boxy, 1960s vintage, smelling faintly of burning dust.

"We have everything from 1950 to last month. What are you looking for?"

"Just browsing. Working on a piece about traveling preachers."

Her face lit up. "Oh, you should talk to Brother Caine! He's doing such wonderful work here."

"I've heard," Dale said neutrally.

She left him alone. Dale exhaled, then started pulling film canisters. He needed to go deeper—every town Elijah had visited, every death, every investigation.

He started with Louisiana, 1976. The earliest incident he'd found.

St. Martin. Population 1,200. Elijah arrived April, left June. Two followers died late May—both elderly women at a faith healing. The *St. Martin Gazette* ran:

**TWO DIE DURING HEALING SERVICE**

Dale leaned closer, adjusting focus. The article detailed how Martha Beaulieu, 72, and Grace Fontenot, 68, collapsed during healing service. Both were pronounced dead on arrival at the county hospital. Autopsies revealed arsenic poisoning.

Communion wine tested positive—trace amounts, not lethal per dose, but cumulative exposure over weeks could kill. Elijah questioned, claimed ignorance. Investigation launched.

Then charges dropped. DA cited "insufficient evidence." Elijah left town two days later. Case went cold.

Dale made notes. *Two deaths, elderly women, arsenic, charges dropped. Pattern: vulnerable victims, chemical method, legal escape.*

Arkansas, 1979. Pine Bluff. Population 900.

Three deaths. River baptism. Elijah conducting mass baptism in White River—forty people, full immersion. Witnesses said Elijah held each person underwater, praying. Most came up gasping.

Three didn't come up at all.

**THREE DROWN IN BAPTISM CEREMONY**

The victims: young adults, twenties and thirties. All three were described as physically capable swimmers, healthy and strong. But Elijah held them under for "an unusually long time"—over a minute, witnesses said. Far longer than normal baptisms.

Pulled from water unconscious. CPR failed. Medical examiner ruled drowning, but noted something strange: all three had ingested sedatives before baptism. Blood tests showed benzodiazepines.

Voluntary? Elijah claimed they must have taken them. "I don't control what they do to prepare their spirits." Investigation followed. But congregation stood by Elijah. Families insisted it was God's will.

Charges filed—negligent homicide. Dropped six weeks later when witnesses recanted. Elijah left town. Case closed.

Dale's hands shook. *Three deaths, young adults, drowning with sedatives, witnesses recanted.*

The pattern was becoming undeniable.

Oklahoma, 1978. Stillwater. Population 1,500.

Four deaths. Fire at prayer vigil.

**FOUR PERISH IN REVIVAL TENT FIRE**

Fifteen followers conducting all-night vigil in side tent. At 3 AM, fire broke out. Eleven escaped. Four did not.

Victims—two men, two women, ages 45-67—found in rear section. Medical examiner: smoke inhalation, but blood tests showed high barbiturates. Fire investigation found accelerant—kerosene—poured around tent perimeter.

Elijah not present. Claimed he'd been sleeping in his trailer. Followers confirmed alibi. Fire ruled arson, no suspects.

Then a break—survivor came forward. Claimed Elijah told the prayer group to take "spiritual medicine," pills to "open their minds to God's voice." She'd pocketed hers instead. Lab tests: barbiturates, high dosage.

Charges filed. Attempted murder, reckless endangerment. Elijah arrested.

Dale held his breath reading follow-ups. This time charges might stick. Physical evidence. Cooperating witness. Then—

Witness disappeared. Vanished. Couldn't be found for trial. Case collapsed. Charges dropped. Elijah released, left Oklahoma within days.

Dale pushed back, rubbing his eyes. The pattern was clear. Elijah moved town to town, established revivals, gained followers. Deaths followed—explained as accidents, spiritual testing, God's will. Investigations launched but never completed. Witnesses recanting or disappearing. Families defending Elijah.

Nine dead across three states over four years. And now Crossroads, with seven missing and a bunker full of prisoners.

Dale found recent holdings—local Texas papers. Nothing about Elijah yet. But property records showed something interesting.

The fairgrounds had been leased to "Elijah Caine Ministries" for six months, starting mid-May. Six months. Far longer than Elijah usually stayed.

Why commit to six months?

Dale's stomach tightened. This time was different. Not just killing a few and moving on. This time, something bigger. The 144,000. The final ascension.

He checked the filing cabinet for fairgrounds history. Found an article from fifteen years ago:

**COUNTY PURCHASES FALLOUT SHELTER FOR FAIRGROUNDS**

Dale's hands froze.

The article described a decommissioned Cold War fallout shelter—built 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Underground, concrete reinforced, designed to house 200 people for two weeks. When nuclear threat faded, the bunker was abandoned. County purchased it in 1965 for tornado shelter and storage.

The fairgrounds were built over it.

Dale grabbed paper, scribbled frantically. *Bunker under fairgrounds. Built 1962. Capacity 200. County-owned, unused. Elijah leased fairgrounds. Has access.*

That's where the missing people were. Seven—maybe ten—imprisoned in a Cold War bunker beneath the tent. Drugged, isolated, being prepared for Elijah's final delusion.

Dale needed blueprints. Building specs. He searched county records. Found "Fairgrounds Development 1965-1970."

Inside: architectural plans.

He spread them on the desk, hands trembling. Bunker schematic showed concrete structure twenty feet underground. Main entrance via stairs from utility building. Secondary emergency exit leading to ventilation shaft three hundred yards east. Internal layout: main chamber, smaller supply rooms, sleeping quarters for families.

Bottom of plan, handwritten note from 1970: *Bunker sealed due to structural concerns. Main entrance locked, county maintenance access only.*

But Elijah had gotten in. Keys or broken locks. Either way, he had access to a massive underground space perfect for imprisoning people.

Dale photographed the blueprints with a small camera from the pharmacy—110 film, cheap but functional. Click, click, click. Evidence.

The librarian appeared in the doorway. "We're closing in five minutes."

Dale checked his watch. 8:55. He'd been researching for ninety minutes. "Thank you. I'm almost done."

He quickly gathered his notes, rewound the microfilm, returned everything to proper places. The librarian watched him with that dreamy smile.

"Did you find what you needed?"

"More than I expected," Dale said truthfully.

"Glory to God. Everything works according to His plan."

Dale felt a chill. Even here, in a library full of evidence of Elijah's crimes, the librarian defended him. That's what cult indoctrination did—made people incapable of seeing truth even when it was archived in black and white.

He left as lights went dark. Outside, night was warm and still. Distant singing from the tent—service ongoing. Ruth, Shauna, and Kimmy would be there, sitting among hundreds of drugged followers.

Dale walked quickly back, clutching his briefcase. His mind raced through discoveries:

- Nine deaths, three states, 1976-1979
- Drugging pattern: arsenic, sedatives, barbiturates
- Investigations stalled or dropped
- Witnesses recanting or disappearing
- Families defending Elijah despite evidence
- Cold War bunker beneath fairgrounds
- Capacity 200 people
- Elijah has access

This was the evidence they needed. Documented history, architectural proof, clear pattern. Not first-time offense but serial behavior. Federal authorities couldn't ignore this.

But something terrified Dale more than the body count.

Elijah had been killing for years. Small numbers, careful escalation. Testing methods, refining approach. Learning what worked—drugging, isolation, manipulation. Learning escape routes—move before investigations completed, ensure follower loyalty.

Now, in Crossroads, with a bunker holding 200 and a six-month lease, Elijah was preparing for his masterwork.

Not nine deaths. Not even twenty.

If Elijah believed he needed 144,000 souls, and if he'd been building toward that goal for years, then Crossroads wasn't just another town.

It was his Jonestown. His Waco. His Heaven's Gate.

The place where he'd finally achieve his apocalyptic vision.

Dale reached the motel, hands shaking. Inside his small room, he spread notes across the bed—newspaper articles, blueprints, timeline charts, photographs. Evidence of a serial killer operating under religious guise for nearly a decade.

Jones and 909 dead in Guyana. Koresh and 76 in Texas. Heaven's Gate and 39 in California.

How many would Elijah kill if they didn't stop him?

How many were already dead in that bunker?

Dale sat and tried to pray. He hadn't prayed—really prayed—in years. Not since seminary, since walking away from ordination. But now, surrounded by evidence of evil dressed in religious language, he found words.

*God, if you're there—help us stop this. Help us save those people. Help me remember that faith is supposed to heal, not harm.*

Outside, singing continued. Hundreds of voices praising a man who planned to kill them.

Dale knew what they had to do tomorrow. Compile evidence. Contact federal authorities. Make the case so clear that help would come.

But tomorrow felt far away.

And Elijah's timeline was unknown.

They were racing against a killer who believed murder was salvation.

Dale pulled out his notebook and began writing a detailed report. Every death, every town, every date. Building the case that would save lives.

Praying it would be enough.
