# Chapter 6: The Families

Ruth Morrison knew how to conduct interviews. Twenty years of parent-teacher conferences had taught her to ask questions gently, listen carefully, and recognize denial.

But nothing had prepared her for this.

The first house was modest—beige siding, chain-link fence. Ruth and Dale stood on the porch, afternoon heat pressing down. Dale looked nervous, clutching his briefcase.

"Let me do the talking," Ruth said. "We're researchers writing about the revival. Follow my lead."

Dale nodded.

Ruth knocked. After a moment, the door opened. A woman in her fifties stood there—graying hair, tired eyes, floral housedress. She smiled when she saw them.

"Can I help you?"

"Mrs. Patterson?" Ruth used her teacher voice, warm but professional. "My name is Ruth Morrison. This is Dale Freeman. We're documenting the revival's effect on Crossroads. We heard your son Michael attended services. We'd love to talk to you about it."

The woman's smile brightened. "Oh, Michael. Yes, come in."

They entered a living room frozen in time—wood paneling, avocado carpet, family photos everywhere. Mrs. Patterson gestured to a floral couch. They sat.

"Michael was so blessed," she said. "Brother Caine saw his light. Knew he was special."

Ruth pulled out her notebook. "When did Michael start attending services?"

"Three weeks ago. Working at the hardware store, no direction. But Brother Caine showed him his purpose." Her eyes were distant, dreamy. "Michael was chosen for early ascension."

Dale leaned forward. "Early ascension. What does that mean?"

Mrs. Patterson's smile was beatific. "The faithful will be called to glory when the tribulation comes. But some are chosen to go first. To prepare the way. Michael was one of them."

"When did you last see Michael?" Ruth asked, pen poised.

"Two weeks ago. Thursday evening. He went to the revival for private prayer. Brother Caine blessed him personally. And then Michael entered the light."

Ruth kept her expression neutral. "Entered the light?"

"Ascended. To heaven. To wait for the rest of us." Mrs. Patterson spoke like she was describing a vacation. No grief. No concern. Just serene acceptance.

"You're not worried about him?" Dale asked, his voice carefully controlled.

"Worried?" Mrs. Patterson looked genuinely confused. "Why would I worry? He's in paradise. Brother Caine explained it all. Michael is one of the 144,000. He's been sealed by God."

Ruth made notes. *No concern for missing son. Believes he "ascended" via Elijah's blessing. Shows same dreamy affect as other townspeople—possible pharmaceutical influence.*

"Did Michael take anything with him? Luggage? Money?"

"No. You don't need earthly possessions in heaven." Mrs. Patterson laughed softly. "His body might be gone, but his soul is with God. That's all that matters."

Dale tried a different approach. "Mrs. Patterson, in scripture, the rapture happens to all believers simultaneously. It's not selective or gradual. Don't you think—"

"Brother Caine explained all that," she interrupted gently. "The early ones prepare the way. It's all in Revelation if you know how to read it properly. Michael is waiting for me. I'll join him when it's my time."

Ruth saw Dale's jaw tighten. She touched his arm—a warning. Don't push. They wouldn't change her mind.

"Thank you, Mrs. Patterson," Ruth said, standing.

"Of course. You should attend a service. Brother Caine could help you too."

Outside, Dale waited until they were down the block. "That was horrifying."

"Textbook cult indoctrination," Ruth agreed. "Same symptoms Shauna described. Dilated pupils, slow responses, emotional flatness."

"Her son is missing. Possibly dead. And she thinks he's in heaven."

"Next family. Two blocks over."

The second house was larger, two-story with a wraparound porch. An elderly couple answered the door together—both in their seventies, the husband stooped with age, the wife using a walker. They invited Ruth and Dale in without hesitation.

"We heard you might have questions about our daughter," the old man said. His name was Mr. Chen, he explained. His wife was Margaret.

"Jennifer was called three weeks ago," Margaret said, settling carefully into a recliner. "We miss her, of course. But we're happy for her. So happy."

She was crying. Not sobbing, just tears streaming down her face while she smiled. The disconnect was unsettling.

"Tell us about Jennifer," Ruth prompted.

Mr. Chen brought out photo albums. Jennifer at twenty-five, dark hair and bright smile, working at the pharmacy in town. She'd started attending revival services two months ago. Got more involved. Volunteered. Attended every service.

"She was always such a good girl," Mr. Chen said. "Brother Caine saw that goodness. He knew she was worthy of early blessing."

"She entered the prayer tent one evening," Margaret added. "We were there. She looked peaceful. Brother Caine said she was ascending."

"You didn't try to stop her?" Dale asked. Ruth shot him a warning look.

But Mr. Chen just smiled sadly. "How could we stop God's will? Jennifer was chosen."

"Have you looked for her?" Ruth asked. "Filed a report?"

"She's not missing," Margaret said firmly. "She's where she's supposed to be. Waiting in paradise."

Ruth took notes while Dale tried theological arguments. The Chens listened politely, dismissed every point. Brother Caine had explained it all.

Leaving, Ruth felt a cold knot. Two families. Same story. Same eerie calm.

"One more," she said. "Then we regroup."

The third house was different.

A middle-aged couple answered—the Daltons—but two teenagers hovered behind them. Maybe sixteen and fourteen. The parents invited Ruth and Dale in, same warm welcome.

But the teenagers looked afraid.

"Our son Marcus was called," Mrs. Dalton said. "Two and a half weeks ago. Twenty-three years old. Brother Caine saw his potential."

Same story. Private prayer. Ascension. Beatific acceptance.

Dale launched into scriptural arguments. Mr. Dalton countered with Elijah's sermons. Ruth observed the teenagers.

The girl—Sarah—kept glancing at the door. The boy—David—had arms crossed, sullen. They weren't buying it.

When Mrs. Dalton went to the kitchen, Ruth moved toward Sarah, pretending to examine photos.

"Are you okay?" Ruth asked quietly.

Sarah's eyes darted to her father, still debating Dale. She leaned closer.

"Something's wrong," she whispered. "Marcus wouldn't just leave. He was saving for a car. He had plans."

"Have you told anyone?"

"Parents won't listen. Sheriff said everything's fine. But I know my brother. This isn't right." Sarah's voice cracked. "No one will help."

Ruth's chest tightened. "I believe you."

Sarah's eyes filled. "Really?"

"Really. We'll figure this out."

Mrs. Dalton returned. Ruth moved back casually. Sarah wiped her eyes.

They left shortly after. Outside, two blocks away, Ruth spoke.

"That girl knows."

"But she's powerless," Dale said. "What can she do?"

"Nothing. But we can."

They walked back in late afternoon heat. Ruth's notebook full of observations, families' identical responses.

This was mass delusion, chemically reinforced and religiously justified.

At the motel, they found Shauna and Levon in Ruth's room. Ruth spread her notes on the bed.

"Three families. Three missing people. All described as 'ascended.' All last seen entering the prayer tent. No appropriate emotional responses—no grief, no urgency."

Shauna examined the notes. "Their physical state?"

"Same symptoms you described. Dilated pupils, slow responses, dreamy affect. Mothers cried while smiling."

"Pharmaceutical influence plus psychological conditioning," Shauna said. "Drugged enough to accept it without question."

Levon leaned against the wall. "I checked the sheriff's office again. No missing person reports filed. Officially, nobody's missing."

"Because officially, they ascended," Dale said.

Ruth sat, exhausted. "That girl Sarah knows. But she can't do anything. Her parents are controlled. Authorities believe Elijah."

"We're not trapped," Shauna said. "We have evidence. We can build a case."

"Against what?" Levon asked. "The families aren't reporting crimes. The sheriff's on his side."

"He's holding people against their will," Ruth said. "Kidnapping. We just need to prove it."

"Which means finding them," Shauna said. "That underground bunker."

"I'll surveil tonight," Levon offered. "Locate the entrance."

Ruth pulled out her notebook. "I'm documenting everything. State authorities will need records."

"Sarah's testimony would help," Dale said.

"She's a minor. Parents won't let her talk to police."

"Then we build the case without her. But when this breaks, she'll need support."

Silence. Outside, the sun angled toward evening. Singing started from the revival tent.

Ruth thought about Mrs. Patterson's smile. The Chens' tears mixed with joy. Sarah's frightened whisper: *This isn't right.*

Seven people missing. Seven families convinced their loved ones were in heaven. And somewhere underground—were they alive? Imprisoned? Being prepared for something worse?

"We're running out of time," Ruth said. "Elijah is building toward something. The 144,000. He thinks he's supposed to deliver that many souls."

"Mass suicide," Shauna said flatly.

"That's what I'm afraid of."

Dale paced. "Jim Jones killed 909 in Jonestown. David Koresh, 76 in Waco. Heaven's Gate, 39. If Elijah believes God commanded him..."

"He won't get 144,000," Levon said. "But even a fraction..."

"Hundreds could die," Ruth finished. "Everyone in that tent."

The singing grew louder. Hundreds of voices. Faithful people chemically conditioned and psychologically manipulated.

Ruth stood. "We work the problem. Gather evidence. Find those seven people. Stop this."

"Four days until the bus is fixed," Shauna said.

"Then we make the most of four days."

Ruth looked at each of them. Dale's theological knowledge. Shauna's medical expertise. Levon's criminal skills. Strangers thrown together. Now the only thing standing between Elijah and mass death.

It wasn't enough. They were outmatched, outnumbered.

But they were all those seven people had. All Sarah had. All this town had.

Ruth opened her notebook to a fresh page. That's what she did. Organized. Planned. Maintained control.

Right now, everything was chaos.

But teachers brought order to chaos. Protected their students.

This town? Her students now.

And she'd be damned if she'd let them walk into a mass grave.
