# Chapter 17: The Final Service Begins

The revival tent was a furnace of bodies and faith.

Ruth stood at the entrance with Dale, watching hundreds stream through the canvas flaps. Folding chairs filled every inch—easily four hundred people, maybe more. Families, elderly folks on canes, teenagers in Sunday best despite the Tuesday evening. The entire town had come, plus visitors from surrounding counties.

"This is bigger than I expected," Dale whispered. His face had gone pale.

"You can still back out," Ruth said.

"No." He adjusted his glasses. "No, I can't."

They'd arrived at six-thirty. The plan: Dale and Ruth near the center aisle for stage access, Levon and Shauna at the perimeter to slip away when chaos began, Kimmy outside at the payphone ready to call police.

Except the service was tonight instead of tomorrow.

Ruth's stomach churned. They'd expected one more day. But when they'd driven past at five PM, the parking area was filling. The banner proclaimed: "FINAL ASCENSION TONIGHT—ALL WELCOME TO GLORY."

Elijah had moved up his timeline.

"I see Shauna," Dale said, nodding toward the tent's left side. Shauna stood against the canvas wall, arms crossed, red hair visible in the crowd. Her medical bag sat at her feet. She caught Ruth's eye and gave a small nod.

Levon was harder to spot—he'd positioned himself at the back, near the prayer tent exit. Good tactical thinking. If they needed to evacuate the bunker during the service, he was already halfway there.

"Let's find seats," Ruth said.

They pushed through the crowd. The tent smelled like sweat and cheap perfume. The industrial fans were off tonight. The air was thick, oppressive. Intentional. Heat made people lightheaded, suggestible.

Overhead lights had been replaced with softer bulbs—shadows at the tent's edges, golden glow on the stage. The massive wooden cross behind the pulpit seemed to float in the dimness.

On the stage, a communion table held an enormous silver chalice. Even from thirty feet away, Ruth could see dark red liquid inside.

Poisoned wine.

They found seats in the fourth row, center aisle. Ruth sat on the aisle, Dale beside her. Around them, conversations buzzed:

"—heard he's going to perform the greatest miracle yet—"

"—my sister saw an angel last service—"

"—tonight we ascend, praise God—"

Ruth's hands gripped the chair's metal edge. These people believed they were about to witness something divine. How many had been drugged into compliance? How many would drink that wine thinking it was salvation?

At seven PM exactly, the lights dimmed.

The crowd hushed—conditioned response.

Music began. "Amazing Grace" filled the tent, four hundred people singing in unison. The sound was overwhelming. Ruth knew the power of group worship, how it dissolved individual thought into collective emotion.

The hymn swelled, and Elijah Caine walked onto the stage.

White three-piece suit glowing under lights, gold cross catching every gleam, silver hair swept back. His blue eyes scanned the congregation, smile warm and prophetic.

The crowd erupted. Applause, shouts, hands raised, weeping.

Elijah raised his hands, and silence fell like a curtain.

"My beloved," he said, and his voice was rich honey, rolling through the tent without a microphone needed. "My chosen. My family. Tonight, the waiting ends."

More shouts. More tears.

"I have preached to you about the end times. About tribulation and glory. About the faithful few who will be called first to ascend." He walked slowly across the stage, hands gesturing, every movement deliberate. "You have listened. You have believed. You have prepared your hearts."

Ruth felt Dale tense beside her.

"Tonight," Elijah continued, his voice rising, "the Lord has spoken to me. He has said, 'Elijah, my instrument, my prophet—the time is NOW.'"

The crowd gasped.

"Not tomorrow. Not next week. Tonight. This hour. This moment." He turned to the communion table, gestured to the chalice. "I have prepared the cup of ascension. Those who drink with me will rise first to glory. We will leave this sinful world behind and enter paradise."

Beside Ruth, Dale whispered, "He's doing it now."

"I know."

"We expected tomorrow—"

"I know." Ruth's mind raced. The plan was falling apart. Levon and Shauna were positioned wrong. Kimmy might not know the service had started early.

But if they didn't act, four hundred people would drink poison. In thirty minutes, they'd start dying.

On stage, Elijah quoted Revelation. "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away." He paced, building rhythm. "The faithful will not taste death but will be transformed in the twinkling of an eye!"

"Amen!" the crowd shouted.

"Who among you is ready?" Elijah's eyes swept the congregation. "Who among you has faith enough to drink with me? To ascend with me? To leave behind this world of pain and enter God's glory?"

Hands shot up. Dozens, then hundreds. People stood, shouting, "I'm ready! Take me, Lord!"

Ruth's heart hammered. This was worse than she'd imagined—not gradual persuasion but mass hysteria. Elijah had primed them perfectly over weeks of services, drugged them into compliance, built them to this fever pitch. Now he was offering them exactly what they'd been conditioned to want.

Eternal life. Escape. Transcendence.

All they had to do was drink.

"Come forward," Elijah called. "Those who are ready, come to the stage!"

People surged from their seats. The aisles clogged with bodies pushing toward the front. Ruth glimpsed familiar faces—the motel clerk, the diner waitress, the pharmacy owner. People she'd spoken with over the past two weeks, now desperate to reach that poisoned chalice.

Then she saw the prisoners.

From the side of the stage, Elijah's inner circle led them out—twenty people in white robes, moving slowly, drugged. The bunker prisoners. They lined up behind Elijah, faces blank.

Ruth recognized the young man whose mother had smiled beatifically. The elderly woman whose daughter vanished. All about to die in front of four hundred witnesses who would call it a miracle.

"My first fruits," Elijah said, gesturing to them. "These blessed souls have been preparing. They will ascend first, and you will witness their transformation!"

The crowd screamed approval.

Dale gripped Ruth's arm. "We have to—"

"Wait." Ruth scanned the tent. Shauna was pushing through the crowd toward the stage's right side. Levon was moving along the back wall toward the prayer tent exit. He was adapting.

But none of it would matter if Elijah distributed that wine before Dale could stop him.

Elijah lifted the silver chalice with both hands, raising it high. The liquid inside caught the light—dark red, gleaming, death disguised as salvation.

"With this cup," Elijah proclaimed, "we ascend!"

The crowd roared.

Dale stood abruptly.

For a moment, he just stood there—a thin man in wrinkled shirt and khakis, glasses slipping, completely unremarkable.

Then he drew a breath and shouted:

"STOP!"

The tent didn't go silent immediately. The roar continued for several seconds before people registered the disruption. Heads turned. The crowd's energy wavered.

Elijah froze, chalice held high, and his blue eyes found Dale in the fourth row.

Long moment. The two men stared at each other across thirty feet and an ocean of belief.

Then Dale shouted again, louder: "Elijah Caine, you pervert scripture!"

Now the silence came—shocked, absolute.

Elijah lowered the chalice slowly. His face showed surprise, then curiosity. He smiled—not angry, but intrigued. Like a cat spotting an unexpected mouse.

"Who are you," Elijah said, his voice carrying easily in the sudden quiet, "to question God's servant?"

Dale pushed past Ruth into the aisle. His hands shook, but his voice was steadier now. "Someone who actually studied theology. Someone who knows scripture. Someone who recognizes a false prophet when he sees one."

Gasps rippled through the congregation. A few shouts of "Blasphemy!" and "Throw him out!"

But Elijah waved them quiet. His security—two large men positioned at the stage's edges—moved forward, but Elijah shook his head. "No. Let him speak." He smiled wider. "I welcome challenges to my faith. I welcome doubt. Come, friend. Come to the stage and tell these good people why you think I'm false."

It was a trap, Ruth realized. Elijah was so confident in his control that he would let Dale challenge him publicly, then crush him in front of the congregation. Demonstrate his authority. Strengthen their faith through this test.

But it was also an opening.

Dale walked down the aisle. Every eye followed him. The crowd's hostility was palpable—hundreds of believers watching a stranger attack their prophet. Ruth saw fists clenched, faces twisted.

If this went wrong, they'd tear him apart.

He climbed the stage steps and stood facing Elijah. The preacher towered over him. The contrast was stark: Elijah in his white suit, commanding; Dale in rumpled clothes, nervous.

But Dale stepped to the second microphone, gripped it, and spoke.

"Revelation 22:18," he said, his voice amplified now, filling the tent. "'If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book.'"

Elijah's smile didn't waver. "I add nothing. I speak God's truth."

"You've added yourself into prophecy," Dale countered. "You claim you're God's instrument for the end times. You claim you can trigger ascension. But you're not mentioned in scripture. You're not prophesied. You're a man with delusions of grandeur."

The crowd murmured—some angry, some uncertain.

Elijah spread his hands. "God works through vessels. Moses was a vessel. Paul was a vessel. Why not Elijah Caine?"

"First Thessalonians 5:2," Dale said. "'The day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night.' It's not scheduled. You can't predict it. You can't cause it. Your ceremony tonight is blasphemy."

For the first time, Elijah's smile faltered.

Ruth watched from her seat, barely breathing. Around her, the congregation's certainty was cracking—just slightly, but visibly. People exchanged glances. Whispered to each other. Doubt, like a hairline fracture in glass.

Dale pressed his advantage. "Matthew 24:36: 'But of that day and hour knoweth no man.' Jesus himself said no one knows when the end comes. But you claim to know? You claim you can trigger it? Either Jesus was wrong, or you are."

The whispers grew louder.

Elijah's face darkened. "You twist scripture, boy."

"I quote it," Dale said. "Accurately. Can you?"

And there it was—the challenge, the gauntlet thrown. In front of four hundred people, Dale Freeman, failed seminary student, had questioned Elijah Caine's biblical authority.

The prophet's hands clenched around the communion chalice.

His knuckles went white.

And Ruth realized with sudden, cold certainty: Elijah wasn't going to debate. He was going to drink. Right now. In front of everyone. To prove his faith was real.

He was going to kill himself to win the argument.

"Elijah, wait—" Dale started.

But Elijah raised the chalice to his lips.
