# Chapter 5: Healings and Questions

Shauna Kelly had seen enough miracle cures in the ER to know they didn't exist.

People came in dying, left alive—that was medicine, not miracles. Antibiotics, surgery, proper trauma protocols. Not prayer.

So when Ruth suggested they attend another service, Shauna agreed for one reason: to observe. To gather evidence.

The morning service was packed. Shauna chose a seat on the aisle near the back. Good vantage point. Easy exit if needed. She opened her large purse, positioned her notebook discreetly where she could take notes without drawing attention.

Ruth sat beside her, spiral notebook already open. Dale fidgeted with his briefcase. Levon sat with arms crossed, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else. Kimmy stared at the stage with an expression that made Shauna's protective instincts flare—too vulnerable, too perfect a target for someone like Elijah.

The singing started. Shauna mouthed along but kept her eyes moving, cataloging. Approximately five hundred attendees. Age range teens to eighties. Working class clothes. Several showed physical signs she recognized from the ER—dilated pupils even in bright light, slight ataxia in their movements, delayed blink responses.

Chemical influence. Had to be.

Elijah took the stage and the crowd erupted. Shauna watched him instead of them, analyzing his performance. His movements practiced, rehearsed to look spontaneous. The smile hit all the right beats—warm, humble, confident. The voice modulation was textbook manipulation—soft when he wanted intimacy, loud when he wanted fervor.

He was very good. She'd give him that.

The sermon washed over her. More apocalyptic rhetoric, more chosen people nonsense. Shauna had grown up Catholic, gone to mass every Sunday until she was eighteen. She knew religious manipulation when she heard it. This was the same playbook, just cranked up to eleven.

Then came the healings.

"Who among you suffers?" Elijah called. "Come forward. Let God work through His servant."

First up: an elderly man with a walker. Arthritis. Elijah laid hands on him, prayed. The man set aside his walker, walked across the stage. Crowd went wild.

Shauna took notes. *Subject 1: Male, 70s. Walker discarded. Check pupils.*

Next: a woman claiming migraines. Elijah touched her temples. She declared herself cured. Shauna wrote: *Subject 2: Female, 40s. Observe symptoms.*

Three more healings followed. Depression "lifted." Back pain "vanished." One woman claimed her diabetes was cured—that one made Shauna's jaw tighten. You didn't cure diabetes with prayer. You managed it with insulin and diet. If that woman stopped her medication because Elijah told her she was healed, she could end up in diabetic ketoacidosis within days.

Shauna made a note to find her after the service, try to convince her to keep monitoring her blood sugar.

The healings concluded. More singing, more preaching. Shauna waited.

Finally, the service ended.

Shauna stood. "I'll meet you at the motel. I need to do something."

Ruth nodded. "Be careful."

Shauna moved through the crowd toward the elderly man. He was standing with people congratulating him, touching him like his healing was contagious.

"Excuse me. I'm a nurse. I'd love to talk about your experience. For my work."

The man beamed. "Of course, sister."

They stepped aside. Shauna pulled out a small penlight from her purse.

"Can I examine you? To document the healing."

He agreed eagerly. Shauna checked his eyes—pupils dilated, reaction time sluggish. She had him walk a straight line—slight ataxia, balance off. She asked questions—responses delayed by half a second.

"How do you feel?" she asked.

"Wonderful. Peaceful. Like I'm floating." He smiled that dreamy smile she'd seen on the waitress, the clerk, everyone in this town. "Brother Caine healed me. The pain is gone."

"When did you last take medication for the arthritis?"

"This morning. But I won't need it anymore."

Shauna made notes in her small notebook. The pattern was clear. He was experiencing pharmaceutical analgesia—pain relief from drugs, not divine intervention. The floating feeling, the euphoria, the dilated pupils. Benzodiazepines, probably. Maybe low-dose opiates. Something to reduce pain and induce calm without causing obvious intoxication.

She thanked him and moved on to the woman with migraines. Same examination. Same results. Dilated pupils, delayed responses, that same floating sensation.

The diabetic woman was harder to find. Shauna eventually spotted her near the exit, surrounded by friends.

"Congratulations on your healing," she said. "Can I ask what type of diabetes you have?"

"Type 2," the woman said. "Had it for eight years. But it's gone now. Brother Caine said so."

Type 2. That was better—at least she wouldn't die immediately without insulin. But still dangerous if she stopped managing it.

"Are you going to continue checking your blood sugar?" Shauna asked.

The woman's smile faltered slightly. "Brother Caine said I'm healed. I don't need to anymore."

"I'm a nurse," Shauna said gently. "I've seen Type 2 go into remission with diet and exercise. But it requires monitoring. Please, keep checking. Just to be safe."

The woman's friends were looking at her with suspicion now. One man stepped forward. "Are you questioning Brother Caine's gift?"

"I'm suggesting medical prudence," Shauna said evenly. But she could see she was losing them. The glazed looks, the defensive postures. They were too far gone.

She retreated before it escalated.

Outside the tent, she found a shaded spot and reviewed her notes. Five subjects examined. Five showing identical symptoms:
- Pupils dilated 3-4mm despite bright light
- Delayed verbal responses (0.5-1 second lag)
- Mild ataxia
- Self-reported "floating" or "peaceful" sensations
- No signs of acute intoxication, suggesting chronic low-dose exposure

She'd seen these symptoms before. Hospital patients on prescribed benzodiazepines. Post-surgery patients on opioid pain management. The dosing here was subtle—not enough to impair function significantly, but enough to create dependency and suggestibility.

The question was: how was he administering it?

Communion wine. Had to be. Everyone took communion at these services. Regular exposure, consistent dosing. Brilliant, in a horrifying way.

Shauna walked back, mind cataloging evidence. She needed to test the wine. Confirm her hypothesis.

At the motel, she found Dale in Ruth's room, agitated, papers spread across the bed.

"You need to see this," he said.

Ruth gestured Shauna to sit. "Dale researched at the library."

Dale pushed photocopies toward her. "I found a pattern."

Shauna read quickly. Oklahoma, 1978. Four followers dead in a house fire during a "prayer vigil." Investigation noted accelerant but ruled it accidental. Elijah left town before the inquiry concluded.

Arkansas, 1979. Three people drowned during a river baptism. Witnesses said Elijah held them under too long. Ruled accidental. Elijah left town immediately after.

Louisiana, 1976. Two followers died from poisoning during a faith healing ceremony. Charges filed, then mysteriously dropped. Elijah left town within a week.

"Nine deaths," Shauna said flatly. "Three states. All ruled accidental."

"And he always leaves before investigations proceed," Dale added.

Ruth was pale. "How is he not in prison?"

"Small towns. Minimal resources. Families defend him—they believe it was God's will."

Shauna felt cold. "Indoctrinated families won't cooperate."

"Exactly."

Levon entered, face grim.

"Got something. Talked to the motel clerk. Seven locals gone missing recently."

Ruth pulled out her notebook. "Seven. That matches."

"Yeah. And I checked the sheriff's office. No missing person reports filed. Not one. Families don't think they're missing."

"Where do they think they are?" Shauna asked.

"Ascended. Called to glory." Levon's voice dripped sarcasm. "Point is, seven people vanished and nobody's looking."

Shauna processed it all. Pharmaceutical control through drugged communion. A preacher with a history of deaths. Seven missing people whose families had been conditioned not to report them.

"He's building toward something," she said. "The drugs create dependency. The preaching creates control. The missing people—"

"Are wherever those three from last night went," Ruth finished. "Underground somewhere."

Dale was pale. "The 144,000. He believes he's supposed to deliver 144,000 souls to God."

"Mass suicide," Shauna said. Not a question.

"I think he's done it before, smaller scales. Now he's building toward something bigger."

Silence filled the room. Outside, singing drifted from the revival tent.

"We need proof," Ruth said. "Evidence they can't ignore."

Shauna nodded. "I'll test the communion wine. Confirm it's drugged."

"I'll research his background more," Dale said.

"I'll surveil the tent. Find where those people went," Levon said.

Ruth wrote it down. "Four days before the bus is fixed. We gather evidence. Then contact state authorities."

"And if they don't listen?" Levon asked.

"Then we make them listen."

Shauna respected Ruth's certainty, but she'd seen how institutions failed people. Her ex-husband had been a cop—she knew how easy it was for the system to look away.

They might be on their own.

"The healings aren't real," Shauna said. "I examined five subjects. All showed pharmaceutical influence. The 'miracle' is just pain relief from drugs."

"So everyone's being drugged," Ruth said.

"Everyone who takes communion. Explains the town-wide compliance."

Dale made a small sound. "That's monstrous."

"That's evidence," Shauna corrected. "I'll get a wine sample tonight. Test it. Have results by morning."

Ruth nodded. "Good."

But progress toward what? They were five strangers in a town of 800 drugged people. The authorities were compromised. The families defended Elijah. Somewhere underground, seven people—maybe more—were being held.

They were outmatched.

But they had evidence. They had skills. They had each other.

It would have to be enough.

Shauna returned to her room. She laid out medical supplies—test strips, sample containers, documentation forms. Tonight she'd get that wine sample. Confirm what she knew.

Then they'd have proof.

One step closer to stopping him.

One step closer to saving those seven people.

If they weren't already dead.

Shauna pushed that thought away. She was good at this—evidence gathering, documentation, objectivity in the face of horror. The ER had trained her well.

Document the crime. Collect the evidence. Save the victims.

Don't think about the nine dead at previous revivals.

Don't think about Kimmy's face when Elijah spoke to her.

Don't think about how many might die if they fail.

Just do the work.
