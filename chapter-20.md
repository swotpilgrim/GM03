# Chapter 20: Evacuation

Levon heard the riot start before he saw it.

He'd been positioned at the tent's back edge, near the prayer tent exit. When Dale had shouted his challenge and the congregation fractured, Levon hadn't waited. He'd moved.

The small prayer tent behind the main stage was locked—same padlock he'd picked three nights ago. His hands remembered the trick of it. Thirty seconds, the lock clicked open, and he was inside.

The stairs descended into darkness.

Levon pulled the flashlight from his jacket pocket—lifted from the truck stop, but he'd pay them back later—and started down. The concrete steps were narrow, steep, institutional. Cold War construction, built to withstand bombs. Now repurposed as a prison.

At the bottom, the steel hatch was closed but not locked from inside. Levon pulled it open.

The bunker spread before him exactly as he remembered—converted fallout shelter, battery lights glowing dim, twenty cots lined up in rows. And on the cots, twenty people in white robes. Some sitting, some lying down, all with the blank expressions of the heavily drugged.

"Alright, listen up!" Levon's voice echoed in the concrete space. "You're being held captive. Elijah Caine is a cult leader, and he was planning to kill you tonight. We're evacuating you. Now."

Twenty pairs of unfocused eyes turned toward him. No comprehension. No movement.

Shit.

Levon walked down the row of cots. The prisoners ranged from teenage to elderly—the seven original missing people plus thirteen more. IVs ran to some of them, fluid bags hanging from makeshift stands. The walls were covered in Elijah's writings—biblical verses, symbols, countdown calendars showing today's date circled in red.

"Can you walk?" Levon asked a middle-aged man in the first cot. The guy whose mother had smiled beatifically when they'd asked about him.

The man blinked slowly. "Ascension. Tonight. Chosen."

"Yeah, no. You're leaving. Can you stand?"

No response. The man's eyes drifted closed.

Levon heard footsteps on the stairs. He spun, fists up—but it was Shauna, medical bag over her shoulder, face set in professional determination.

"Thank God," Levon breathed.

"How many?" Shauna was already moving to the first cot, checking vitals, examining IV sites.

"Twenty. They're all drugged to hell."

"I can see that." Shauna pulled the IV from the middle-aged man's arm, applied pressure, taped it off. "We need to move them now. Elijah ran—he could come back, or his inner circle might try to finish this."

Levon nodded. "Triage?"

"Fast." Shauna moved down the row, her trained eyes assessing each prisoner in seconds. She pulled medical tape from her bag, started marking them. "Green tape—can walk with help. Yellow—need carrying. Red—critical, treat first."

She worked quickly. Levon watched her mark seven green, eleven yellow, two red.

"The reds?" he asked.

"Dehydrated, malnourished, possible overdose. They need IVs and ambulances." She pulled syringes from her bag. "I'm giving them fluids now, but they can't be moved far."

"Do what you can. I'll start with the greens."

Levon moved to the first green-taped prisoner—a young woman, maybe twenty, long hair matted. "Hey. Look at me. Can you stand?"

She blinked. "Angel said... wait here."

"No angel. Just a sick man. Come on." Levon put his arm under her shoulders, lifted. She came up unsteadily, legs shaking. "That's it. Walk with me."

He half-carried her toward the stairs. She stumbled, nearly fell, but Levon kept her upright. Eight years in prison had kept him strong—carrying a drugged woman was manageable.

At the stairs, the woman balked. "Outside? We're not supposed—"

"You're supposed to live," Levon said bluntly. "Climb."

They climbed. Slow, painful, one step at a time. The woman leaned heavily on him, breathing hard. At the top, the prayer tent was dark and empty. Levon guided her through to the tent's back exit, away from the main congregation chaos.

Night air hit them—still warm, but fresher than the bunker's stale atmosphere. The woman gasped, blinked in the moonlight.

Then she started crying.

"I was... we were going to..." Her voice broke. "He said we'd ascend. He said God chose us. I believed him."

"I know." Levon had no comfort to offer. "Sit here. Don't move. Ambulances are coming."

He left her sitting in the dirt outside the prayer tent and went back down.

Shauna had two more greens standing—an elderly man and a teenage boy. Both swaying, confused, but ambulatory.

"Get them up," Shauna said without looking up from where she was inserting an IV into a red-tagged woman. "I'll handle the critical cases."

Levon made trip after trip. Up and down the stairs, carrying the greens one by one. Some walked with minimal help. Others he practically dragged. One man fought him, screaming about betraying the ascension, and Levon had to restrain him—gently but firmly—until Shauna could sedate him.

"Sorry, man," Levon muttered, lowering the unconscious prisoner to the ground outside. "Better alive and pissed than dead and grateful."

By the seventh trip, his muscles burned. The stairs seemed to multiply. But he kept moving.

The yellow-tagged prisoners were harder. They couldn't walk at all. Levon had to carry them—dead weight, limp bodies, arms dragging. He fireman-carried a young man, then an elderly woman, then another, his back screaming protest.

Shauna appeared at the stairs carrying a teen girl, no older than Kimmy. The girl's head lolled against Shauna's shoulder.

"Last yellow," Shauna said. "The two reds are stable enough to leave while I get help. We need paramedics down here."

"I'll call it in." Levon pulled the borrowed walkie-talkie from his belt—he'd lifted it from a tent security guard during the chaos. He keyed the mic. "Ruth, you copy?"

Static. Then Ruth's voice, strained but clear: "Copy. Levon?"

"Bunker's clear. Twenty evacuated. Two critical still down here needing immediate medical transport. How's topside?"

"Chaos. Sheriff finally showed up. State police are five minutes out. I told them we have mass casualty potential."

"Not potential. Actual. Twenty drugged prisoners, two critical. We need ambulances at the prayer tent. Now."

"I'll make sure they know." A pause. "You okay?"

Levon looked at the prisoners scattered in the dirt outside—some crying, some blank-faced, some beginning to understand what had almost happened to them. Twenty lives that would have ended tonight if Dale hadn't found his courage, if Shauna hadn't grabbed her evidence, if Ruth hadn't organized them.

Twenty lives Levon Ritter, ex-con and fuckup, had helped save.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "Yeah, I'm okay."

He clicked off the walkie and looked at Shauna. She was back down in the bunker, kneeling beside the two red-tagged prisoners—the ones too sick to move. She'd set up proper IVs, was monitoring breathing, doing everything she could with limited supplies.

Levon climbed back down to help.

"Talk to me," he said.

"This one's hypothermic despite the heat—that's the drugs. This one's got a heart arrhythmia. Both need hospitals yesterday." Shauna's hands moved efficiently, but her voice was tight. "If we'd been an hour later..."

"We weren't."

"An hour, Levon. We were cutting it that close."

He put a hand on her shoulder. "But we weren't late. We were here. You were here."

She looked up at him, and he saw the weight of it in her eyes—the knowledge of how close this had come to mass death. Hundreds of people, including these twenty, nearly gone because one sick man heard voices.

"I need to stay with these two until the paramedics get here," Shauna said.

"I'll wait with you."

They sat in the bunker—the prison that almost became a tomb—with two unconscious prisoners and the smell of stale air and chemical sedatives. The walls were still covered in Elijah's writings. Revelations quotes. Countdowns. Maps of ascension.

Levon read them by battery light. The handwriting degraded from neat script to frantic scrawl. The theology spiraled from orthodox to delusional. The timeline showed two years of planning—recruiting, preparation, building toward tonight.

"He really believed," Levon said.

"Doesn't make it okay."

"No. But it makes it sadder." Levon had known criminals—con men, thieves, killers. Most knew exactly what they were doing. Elijah was different. Elijah had genuinely thought he was saving people by killing them.

That was its own kind of horror.

Footsteps echoed down the stairs—heavy boots, multiple people. Levon tensed, but then he heard: "Paramedics! Who needs medical?"

Relief flooded through him. "Down here! Two critical!"

The paramedics descended with equipment and efficiency. They assessed the red-tagged prisoners, confirmed Shauna's IVs, started preparing for transport. Professional, competent, asking the right questions.

Shauna briefed them rapidly: "Benzodiazepine overdose, multiple days' exposure, probable malnutrition and dehydration. This one's hypothermic, that one's got cardiac involvement. I've given fluids but they need full workup and monitoring."

The lead paramedic nodded. "You a nurse?"

"ER, Houston Memorial."

"Good work. Probably saved their lives with those IVs."

Shauna stood. Levon saw her hands shaking now that the adrenaline was fading. He took her medical bag, slung it over his own shoulder.

They climbed the stairs one last time.

Outside, the compound was controlled chaos. State police cars with flashing lights, ambulances loading prisoners, families reuniting in tears. The main revival tent was empty now—congregation dispersed, service ended, cult broken.

Sheriff stood with Ruth, taking her statement. Kimmy hovered nearby, looking small and scared. Dale sat on the ground, head in his hands, shaking from the aftermath of his confrontation.

Levon and Shauna walked toward them.

Ruth looked up, saw them, and her professional composure cracked for just a moment. Relief flooded her face. "You're okay."

"All twenty accounted for," Levon said. "Two critical, but the paramedics have them. Everyone else is drugged but stable."

"Elijah?"

"Ran. Didn't see which direction."

Ruth nodded. "Highway patrol's been alerted. They'll find him."

A state police detective approached—thirties, sharp eyes, already taking notes. "You the ones who broke this open?"

Ruth straightened. "We are. I have documented evidence for you. Medical tests, photographs, witness statements, and Elijah Caine's journal detailing the entire plan."

The detective's eyebrows rose. "You documented a cult investigation?"

"We're thorough."

He almost smiled. "I need full statements from all of you. But first—" He extended his hand. "Thank you. If you hadn't acted tonight, we'd be processing four hundred bodies."

Levon shook the offered hand. His own hand was rough, scarred from prison labor, but the detective didn't flinch.

"Just did what needed doing," Levon said.

But inside, standing there with official recognition and gratitude from law enforcement—him, the ex-con, the parolee, the guy society had written off—Levon felt something unfamiliar settle in his chest.

Pride. Not the false kind that came from dominance or violence. Real pride, earned through protecting people.

Redemption wasn't granted. It was earned through action.

And tonight, for the first time in eight years, Levon Ritter had earned it.
