# Chapter 4: The Pull

Kimmy had learned to make herself small. Invisible was safe. Invisible meant her stepfather might forget she existed, might leave her alone for one more night.

But Preacher Caine saw her.

His eyes found hers in the crowd like she was the only person in the tent. Like she mattered.

"Excuse me, brothers and sisters. I need to speak with this child."

And he came to her.

Kimmy's heart hammered. Ruth was beside her somewhere, and the others, but suddenly they seemed far away. There was just Preacher Caine, kneeling, his hands taking hers gently.

"Hello, child. I don't believe we've met."

Up close, his eyes were so blue. Blue like promise.

"No, sir," she managed.

"What's your name?"

"Kimmy."

"Kimmy." The way he said it made it sound special. Not a curse. "You've been traveling far, haven't you? Looking for home."

The tears came before she could stop them. How did he know? How could he possibly know?

"How—how did you know?"

He smiled. "God shows me things. He tells me who needs His love most. And you, sweet child, you need so much love. You've been hurt. The people who should have protected you failed you. But you don't have to run anymore."

Kimmy couldn't breathe. He knew. He knew about her mother who looked away, about the bruises under long sleeves, about the nights in the Greyhound station deciding if she was brave enough to leave.

He knew, and he wasn't disgusted. He was offering exactly what she'd been searching for.

"I don't?" she whispered.

"No." His hands squeezed hers, warm and solid. "You can stay here. You can be part of our family. The family of God never abandons its children. We take care of each other. Forever."

Forever. The word hung in the air like a promise. Like salvation.

Then Ruth's hand was on her shoulder, firm and grounding. "Thank you, Preacher Caine. We appreciate your words. But Kimmy is with us."

Preacher Caine looked up at Ruth, and Kimmy saw something flicker in his expression. Not anger, exactly. More like... assessment. Like he was calculating something.

"Of course," he said smoothly, standing. "Family is sacred. I'm glad she has you." He looked at Kimmy again, and his smile softened. "But if you need anything, child, you come find me. Our evening service is at seven. Special blessings for newcomers. I'd love to see you there."

"Thank you," Kimmy managed.

And then he was gone, moving through the crowd, and Kimmy felt the absence like cold water.

Ruth steered her toward the exit. The others followed—Dale with his worried face, Shauna looking sharp and analytical, Levon radiating suspicion. Outside, the sun was blinding. Kimmy blinked away tears and tried to find her balance.

They walked back in silence. Then Dale started talking.

"That was cold reading. A technique mentalists use. He looked at you—your age, your clothes—and made educated guesses."

"He said specific things," Kimmy protested quietly.

"That's how it works. He says something vague—'you've been hurt'—and you fill in the details in your mind. Your brain does the work for him."

Shauna nodded. "Like psychics on TV. They say something general and people think it's magic."

"This is different," Kimmy said, but her voice was so small they might not have heard.

Levon, walking behind them, spoke up. "It's a con. Classic cult recruitment. Find the vulnerable person, tell them you understand their pain, offer them belonging. Then you own them."

The word "vulnerable" stung. Was that what she was? Just another mark for a con man?

But Preacher Caine's eyes had been so kind.

They reached the diner and filed into a booth. Ruth organized everyone. Kimmy picked at a napkin, not hungry.

"Should we go tonight?" Dale asked. "To the evening service?"

"No," Levon said.

"Yes," Ruth said. "We need to see more."

"I want to go," Kimmy heard herself say.

Everyone looked at her. She shrank under their attention, but forced herself to continue. "I want to see it again. I want to... understand."

Ruth studied her, then nodded. "We go together. We stay together."

---

The evening service started at seven. Kimmy walked with the group through gathering dusk, watching the revival tent glow. Lanterns and electric lights turned the canvas into a beacon.

More people tonight. The tent was packed—six hundred people, maybe more. The atmosphere felt different. More intimate. Candlelight instead of harsh daylight. Shadows flickering on canvas walls.

They found seats further back. Kimmy sat between Ruth and Dale, but she felt herself leaning forward, drawn toward the stage.

The singing started. Hymns she didn't know, but beautiful. Repetitive, building. Everyone sang with eyes closed, swaying. Kimmy found herself swaying too.

Dale leaned close. "Notice how they repeat phrases. It's hypnotic."

Kimmy heard him, but the words didn't stick. The music was so beautiful. Hundreds of people united in one sound. When had she ever been part of something like this?

The singing went on for what felt like hours. Song flowing into song, same phrases over and over. "Come to the light." "Prepare for glory." "The faithful shall ascend."

Then the tent went dark.

Kimmy gasped along with others. Only candles remained, flickering. Shadows alive.

A single spotlight illuminated the stage.

Elijah Caine walked into the light.

The congregation erupted. More fervent tonight. Almost desperate. People stood with hands raised, tears streaming.

Elijah waited for silence. Then he spoke.

"Brothers and sisters, beloved children—tonight is special. Tonight we prepare for what's coming. The end times grow closer. I feel them approaching like a storm on the horizon. Do you feel it?"

"Yes!" the congregation shouted.

"The world is ending, brothers and sisters. Revelation is unfolding as we speak. Wars and rumors of wars. Pestilence. Famine. The signs are everywhere for those with eyes to see. And when the tribulation comes—when the world burns—only the chosen will be saved."

Kimmy felt chills run down her arms despite the heat.

"Some among you will be called first," Elijah continued. "Some are already chosen. Already marked for early ascension. They will go ahead, prepare the way, wait for us in glory."

He gestured to a side area Kimmy hadn't noticed. Past the main stage—a smaller tent, fabric walls creating a separate chamber.

"The prayer tent," Elijah said. "For those who have been called. For those who hear God's voice saying 'come, child, come home.' If you feel that calling tonight—come forward. Enter the prayer tent. Receive your blessing."

The congregation waited, breathless.

One woman stood. Middle-aged, plain dress, face transformed. She walked forward, entered the small tent. The flap closed.

Then a young man. Then an older man.

Three people entered. The service continued—more singing, more preaching. An hour passed. Two hours.

The three never came back out.

Kimmy watched the tent flap. Closed. Still.

"Where did they go?" she whispered to Dale.

His face was grim. "I don't know."

Beside her, Ruth was taking notes in her spiral notebook. Shauna was counting something on her fingers. Levon was tense, jaw tight, eyes tracking everything.

The service built to a crescendo. Elijah preached about the 144,000 again, about being chosen, about ascension and glory and the faithful being saved while the world burned. His voice rose and fell like music, like waves, like something that could carry you away if you let it.

Kimmy felt herself being carried.

It would be so easy. To stand up. To walk forward. To enter that prayer tent and let Preacher Caine tell her she was chosen, special, worth saving. To stop running and finally, finally find home.

She started to stand.

Ruth's hand clamped on her wrist. Not rough, but firm. Grounding.

Kimmy looked at her. Ruth's eyes were calm behind her glasses, steady. Concerned.

"Wait," Ruth said quietly. "Just wait."

Kimmy sat back down. Her heart was racing. What had she almost done?

The service ended near ten o'clock. Three hours. Kimmy felt drained, wrung out.

The crowd dispersed slowly, reluctant. Kimmy watched the prayer tent. Still closed. Still no sign of the three who'd entered.

"We need to find out where that tent leads," Shauna said quietly as they filed out with the crowd.

"Underground," Levon said. "Has to be. They didn't come back through the main tent."

"Underground where?" Dale asked.

"That's what we need to figure out."

They emerged into cool night air. Stars thick and bright above. Kimmy looked up and felt very small.

"Are you okay?" Ruth asked.

"I don't know. I almost went up there. I almost went into that tent."

"I know."

"Why didn't I?"

Ruth smiled, tired but genuine. "Because you're stronger than you think. And because you're not alone anymore."

They walked back through empty streets. The town silent except for crickets.

In her room, Kimmy stood at the window looking out at the tent. White canvas glowing faintly in starlight. From here, it looked peaceful. Beautiful, even.

She thought about Preacher Caine's eyes. His kind smile. His promise of family, of forever, of never being alone again.

She thought about her stepfather's hands. Her mother's silence. The nights she'd spent hiding, afraid, hurting.

She thought about Ruth's firm grip on her wrist. Dale's worried face. Shauna's protective edge. Even Levon's rough suspicion felt like care.

Kimmy pulled out her sketchbook and began to draw. The five of them in the diner booth. Ruth organizing. Dale with his books. Shauna sharp-eyed. Levon guarded. And her, small in the middle, but not alone.

Not alone.

She drew until her hand cramped, trying to capture that feeling. Trying to remember it so when the pull came again—and she knew it would come again—she'd have something to hold onto.

Outside, the revival tent waited in the darkness. Inside her chest, something warred—the desperate need for belonging fighting against the small, stubborn part of her that whispered: *This isn't right. Something's wrong.*

Kimmy closed her sketchbook and climbed into bed. Tomorrow they'd figure out where those three people went. Tomorrow they'd understand more.

Tonight, she just had to hold on.

Tomorrow. Just get to tomorrow.

She fell asleep repeating it like a prayer.
