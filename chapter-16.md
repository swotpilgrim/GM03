# Chapter 16: The Plan

Ruth's motel room smelled like burnt coffee and rattling air conditioner exhaust. The map of the revival compound covered the bed—hand-drawn by Levon, surprisingly detailed. Red pen marked entry points. Blue showed evacuation routes. Black X's indicated security positions.

Two days before Elijah's Ascension Ceremony turned four hundred people into the worst mass death in American history.

"Okay," Ruth said, standing at the foot of the bed like a general addressing troops. "Let's go through this one more time."

Dale sat in the corner chair, legal pad balanced on his knees, pages filled with scripture references. His hand shook slightly as he adjusted his glasses. "I confront Elijah during evening service. Take the microphone, challenge him theologically in front of the congregation."

"Specifically?" Ruth asked.

"Revelation 22:18—adding to prophecy. First Thessalonians 5:2—the day comes like a thief, can't be scheduled. Matthew 24:36—no man knows the hour." Dale's voice steadied as he recited. "I break his scriptural authority. If the congregation sees him stumble on theology, they'll question everything."

Shauna leaned against the dresser, arms crossed. "And if they don't question? If they're too far gone?"

"Then we've created chaos anyway," Levon said from where he slouched against the wall. "Chaos is when Shauna and I move."

Ruth nodded. "During the confrontation, you two get to the prayer tent. How long to evacuate twenty people?"

Levon studied his sketch. "Depends on their condition. If they're ambulatory, ten minutes. If we're carrying dead weight..." He shrugged. "Twenty, maybe thirty."

"I can triage fast," Shauna said. "Mark who walks, who needs help, who's critical. We get them out and away from the compound before anyone notices they're gone."

"Someone will notice," Dale said quietly.

"That's why timing matters." Ruth moved to the window, looked out at the revival tent dominating the horizon. Even in daylight it looked wrong—too white, too perfect, a scar on the Texas scrubland. "Kimmy and I stay topside. The second Dale takes that microphone, Kimmy calls state police from the payphone. Not the sheriff—state police directly."

"They didn't respond before," Shauna pointed out.

"They will when I tell them there's an active crisis. Four hundred people, poisoned communion, mass casualty event in progress." Ruth's jaw tightened. "They'll have to respond. We give them no choice."

The room fell silent except for the air conditioner's rattle. Evening light slanted through the window, turning cigarette burns in the carpet into tiny shadows.

"What if it goes wrong?" Kimmy's voice was small from where she sat on the floor, sketchbook in her lap. "What if Elijah's people hurt you?"

"Then we've got problems," Levon said bluntly.

"Levon." Ruth shot him a look.

He pushed off the wall. "She asked. You plan for the likely scenario, but shit can turn sideways fast." He looked at Kimmy. "If his inner circle gets violent, we scatter. Meet back here. Call the cops and let them handle it."

"But the prisoners—" Kimmy started.

"Will die if we're all dead," Shauna finished. "Levon's right. We're not martyrs. We do what we can, but we don't sacrifice ourselves."

Dale set down his legal pad. "I'm most likely to get hurt. I'll be exposed, on stage, surrounded."

"Can you handle that?" Ruth asked.

He was quiet for a moment. "I don't know. Public speaking terrifies me. Confrontation makes me want to vomit. But..." He picked up Elijah's journal from the nightstand—the one Levon had stolen from the bunker. "I read this three times. He believes God chose him. His followers believe it too. If I don't challenge that belief, they'll drink poison thinking they're going to heaven."

"That a yes?" Levon asked.

"That's a yes."

Ruth allowed herself a small smile. "Then let's prepare."

The next hour blurred into focused activity. Dale spread his theology books across the bed, highlighting passages, rehearsing rebuttals. He muttered to himself, practicing projection—his normal voice too soft for a tent full of people.

"Louder," Ruth coached. "You need to command that space."

"Elijah Caine, you pervert scripture!" Dale shouted, then immediately looked embarrassed. "Too much?"

"Perfect. Confidence sells it. Even if you're faking."

Levon reviewed the bunker layout again, timing evacuation scenarios in his head. "What if the prisoners resist?" he asked Shauna. "If they're too indoctrinated?"

"We carry them anyway. Sedation if necessary." She patted her canvas medical bag. "I've got enough diazepam to calm a dozen people. Not ideal, adding drugs on top of drugs, but better than letting them die."

"You sure? If you dose someone wrong..."

Shauna's green eyes were steady. "I've worked ER for six years. I know dosing. Trust me."

Levon held her gaze, then nodded. "Okay."

Ruth organized the evidence folder—photographs of the bunker, Shauna's medical tests, Dale's research on Elijah's previous revivals, testimonies from families. Everything documented, ready to hand to authorities. She added a typed timeline and a one-page summary. Investigators would have everything they needed.

Kimmy sketched in the corner, pencil moving rapidly. When Ruth looked over her shoulder, she saw the five of them drawn as superheroes—Dale with a bible-shield, Shauna with a medical cross, Levon breaking chains, Ruth with a sword, Kimmy holding a light.

"That's us?" Ruth asked.

Kimmy looked up, suddenly shy. "Too dumb?"

"No." Ruth's throat tightened unexpectedly. "It's perfect."

---

Seven o'clock found them crammed into a booth at the truck stop diner. Last supper before the battle, though nobody said it aloud. The waitress—the same one who'd served them that first night, a lifetime ago—brought burgers and milkshakes without being asked.

"Y'all look serious," she said, cracking her gum. "Everything okay?"

"Fine," Ruth said with a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Just tired."

When she left, Levon picked at his fries. "So. We should talk about what happens if this goes bad."

"Levon—" Ruth started.

"No, he's right." Dale set down his burger. "We need to acknowledge the risks."

Shauna sipped her chocolate shake. "I'll start. My ex-husband was Houston PD. I have a restraining order against him. He monitors police reports—has cop friends who tip him off when my name appears." She kept her voice level, clinical. "If I get arrested tomorrow, he'll know where I am within hours. That's... not good for me."

Silence. Kimmy reached over and squeezed Shauna's hand.

"You could sit this out," Ruth said quietly.

"No." Shauna's voice was flat. "Twenty people in that bunker. I'm not sitting out."

Levon cleared his throat. "My turn. I'm on parole. Technically, I'm violating right now—supposed to report my location, not supposed to break into buildings or steal evidence." He laughed without humor. "If we get caught tomorrow, I'm going back to Huntsville. Eight years I served. They'll add more for violation."

"Jesus," Dale breathed.

"It's fine." Levon shrugged, but his jaw was tight. "I knew the deal when I went into that bunker the first time. Some things matter more than staying free."

Dale stared at his hands. "I'm terrified of public speaking. Did I mention that? In seminary, I'd get physically sick before presentations. Panic attacks. They told me it was the devil trying to stop me from preaching God's word." He laughed bitterly. "Turns out it's just anxiety. And tomorrow I'm walking into a tent with four hundred hostile people and challenging their prophet."

"You don't have to," Ruth said.

"Yes, I do." Dale met her eyes. "This is the first time in two years I've felt like my theology degree meant something. Like I wasted four years of my life for a reason. I have to do this."

Ruth felt the weight of their confessions settling on her shoulders. "I've been terrified since we started investigating. The whole time. Every decision I've made, I've second-guessed. What if I'm wrong? What if someone gets hurt because I pushed us into this?" She gripped her coffee cup. "But I keep thinking about those seven families. How they smiled when we asked about their missing loved ones. Like it was fine. Like disappearing was normal."

"It's not normal," Kimmy said softly.

"No. It's not." Ruth looked around the table at four people who'd been strangers ten days ago. "So tomorrow we stop it. And whatever happens after... we deal with it."

Levon raised his water glass. "To dealing with it."

They clinked glasses—water, milkshakes, coffee. A toast that felt both ridiculous and sacred.

The jukebox in the corner played the Eagles. "Take It Easy" bled into the space between them, filling the silence with guitars and harmonies about standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona. Wrong state, Ruth thought, but the same endless American highway. The same liminal spaces between destinations.

"Can I ask something?" Kimmy looked up from her half-eaten burger. "After tomorrow... will we stay in touch? Or is this just, like, a weird thing that happened and then we all go back to normal?"

Ruth opened her mouth, unsure how to answer.

"I'll stay in touch," Shauna said. "You people have seen me cry. That's basically marriage."

Levon snorted. "I don't cry, but yeah. Y'all are the only people who know about the parole shit and didn't treat me like a convict. So. Yeah."

"I'd like to stay in touch," Dale said earnestly. "I mean, if you want. I don't have many friends. Well, any friends, really."

"Dale." Ruth smiled despite herself. "Of course we'll stay in touch."

Kimmy beamed, and it transformed her face—made her look seventeen instead of forty.

They finished eating slowly, dragging out the moment. Nobody wanted to return to the motel, to the reality of tomorrow. Here, in the diner's fluorescent warmth with grease-smell and coffee and the Eagles singing about peaceful easy feelings, they could pretend this was normal. Five friends sharing a meal.

But through the window, the revival tent glowed white in the distance. Floodlights illuminated it like a beacon. Or a warning.

Tomorrow, Ruth thought. Tomorrow we find out if we're heroes or fools.

She suspected the line between them was thinner than anyone wanted to admit.

---

They paid the check—Levon insisted on covering Kimmy's meal—and walked back to the motel in the gathering dark. The heat had finally broken. Somewhere in the scrubland, a coyote yipped.

At Ruth's door, they paused.

"Six PM tomorrow," Ruth said. "Final service starts at seven. We go in together, split up inside."

Nods all around.

"Get some sleep," Shauna said.

But none of them would sleep much. Ruth knew that. They'd lie awake playing through scenarios, imagining disasters.

She watched them disperse to their rooms. Dale clutching his theology books. Shauna's medical bag over her shoulder. Levon's hands shoved in his pockets. Kimmy with her sketchbook tucked under one arm.

Her team. Her people.

Please, Ruth thought—to who or what, she didn't know. Please let this work.

The revival tent glowed in the distance, waiting.
