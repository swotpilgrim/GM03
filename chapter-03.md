# Chapter 3: Elijah Caine

Dale Freeman had attended revival services before. Growing up Baptist in Dallas, he'd been to tent meetings, faith healings, traveling evangelists with big voices and bigger promises. He knew the formula.

But walking toward this tent at ten o'clock Wednesday morning, he felt something different. Fear, maybe.

This was going to be bad.

"You don't have to go," Ruth said to Kimmy for the third time. The girl walked between them, quiet and small in her long sleeves despite the heat.

"I want to," Kimmy said softly.

Shauna walked on Kimmy's other side, large purse slung over her shoulder, eyes assessing. Levon trailed behind, hands in his pockets, radiating hostility. He'd made his position clear over breakfast—this was stupid. But he'd come anyway.

The revival tent dominated the landscape. White canvas stretched over a massive frame, the peak crowned with a fifteen-foot wooden cross. From inside came the sound of singing—hundreds of voices in harmony.

They joined the stream of people entering. Working class clothes, sun-faded. Farmers and shopkeepers, waitresses and mechanics. They filed in with quiet reverence, faces calm.

Inside, the tent was enormous. Five hundred people, maybe more. Rows of wooden folding chairs faced a raised stage. Industrial fans hung from the canvas ceiling, barely cutting the heat. The smell—sweat, canvas, something sweet like incense.

They found seats in the middle. Dale sat between Ruth and Kimmy, briefcase on his lap. He'd brought a notebook. If he was going to witness this, he'd document it.

The singing continued—old hymns. "Amazing Grace," "How Great Thou Art." The congregation knew every word, sang without hymnals. Dale found himself mouthing along despite his better judgment.

Then the singing stopped.

Five hundred people went silent at once, waiting. Dale felt his pulse quicken.

The stage was simple—rough wooden planks, a pulpit, the massive cross behind it. Industrial lights created a glow that made the stage seem separate, liminal.

And then Elijah Caine walked out.

Dale knew charisma when he saw it. Elijah Caine had it in spades.

Tall, maybe six-three, broad-shouldered but lean. Silver hair swept back from a strong face, piercing blue eyes that seemed to see everything at once. He wore a white three-piece suit that should have looked ridiculous in this heat but somehow didn't. A gold cross pendant hung on his chest, catching the light. His hands were large, expressive, already moving even though he hadn't spoken.

He stood at the pulpit and smiled.

The congregation erupted. Five hundred people on their feet, hands raised, faces rapturous. Dale stayed seated, taking notes. Ruth sat rigid. Shauna counted something. Levon had his arms crossed, jaw tight.

Kimmy was standing. She was clapping with everyone else, her face open and hopeful.

Elijah raised his hands and the crowd went silent instantly. No gradual quieting—just immediate obedience. Dale wrote: *Perfect crowd control.*

When Elijah spoke, his voice filled the tent. Deep baritone, resonant.

"Brothers and sisters, children of God, blessed and beloved—welcome."

Textbook techniques, but executed flawlessly.

"We are gathered here in the shadow of the end times," Elijah continued. "The world grows dark. Evil surrounds us. The faithful are tested. But we—we have been chosen. Called out from the darkness. Prepared for glory."

Dale recognized the theology—apocalyptic urgency, the elect versus the damned. But twisted, personalized. Elijah wasn't just preaching about the end times. He was positioning himself within them.

"The book of Revelation speaks truth," Elijah said, opening a Bible with practiced ease. His fingers found the page without looking. "Chapter seven, verse four: 'And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.'"

Dale knew where this was going. The 144,000. Every doomsday preacher's favorite number.

"One hundred forty-four thousand souls," Elijah repeated, his voice dropping to an intimate rumble that somehow still carried to the back of the tent. "Sealed by God. Protected. Chosen for ascension when the tribulation comes. And brothers and sisters—" He paused, let the silence stretch. "—that tribulation is coming soon."

The congregation murmured agreement. Dale saw heads nodding, people whispering to neighbors.

"How do I know?" Elijah smiled, and there was something unsettling about it. "Because God told me. He speaks to me, brothers and sisters. He shows me visions. He has given me a sacred task—to gather the faithful. To prepare the chosen. To deliver 144,000 souls to glory when the end comes."

Dale stopped taking notes. His hand had gone cold.

Jim Jones. David Koresh. Charismatic leaders who believed God spoke directly to them, who built toward apocalyptic events that ended in mass death.

This was textbook cult psychology.

Elijah was preaching in earnest now, quoting Revelation, describing the tribulation. His voice rose and fell, hands gesturing. The crowd swayed with him, synchronized, entranced.

Dale leaned toward Ruth. "This is dangerous," he whispered.

She nodded without taking her eyes off Elijah.

The sermon built to a crescendo—Elijah's voice filling the tent, sweat showing through his white suit, eyes wide and fervent. He looked possessed.

"And now," Elijah said, his voice suddenly soft, "let us witness the power of God. Who among you needs healing? Come forward."

An elderly woman stood from the front row. She had a cane, moved slowly. Dale watched as she made her way to the stage.

Elijah descended to meet her, taking her hands in his. The microphone didn't catch his words, but Dale saw his lips moving, saw the woman's face transform—from pain to hope to something like ecstasy.

"What is your affliction, sister?" Elijah asked, loud enough for everyone to hear now.

"My legs," the woman said, her voice trembling. "I can't walk without the cane. Haven't in years. The pain—"

"The pain ends today," Elijah said with absolute certainty. He placed his hands on her head, closed his eyes. "In the name of Jesus Christ, I command this affliction to leave. I command healing. I command wholeness. Be healed!"

The woman gasped. Elijah stepped back, gestured to the cane. "You don't need that anymore."

She looked at the cane, then at Elijah, then dropped it. The clatter echoed in the silent tent.

She took one step. Then another. Walking without support, her face radiating joy.

The congregation exploded—shouting, crying, applauding. The woman walked across the stage, arms raised, praising God. People surged forward, wanting to touch her, to witness the miracle up close.

Dale calculated probabilities. Placebo effect. Or a plant. Or drugged, suggestible.

But the crowd didn't see explanations. They saw a miracle.

"It could be any of those things," Shauna murmured beside him, echoing his thoughts.

"It's theater," Levon muttered from behind.

"It's effective," Ruth said grimly.

The service continued for another hour. More healings, testimonials, singing. Dale took notes until his hand cramped.

Finally, the service ended. Elijah raised his hands in benediction.

"Go in peace. Return tonight for evening service. The time is short. The ascension is coming."

The crowd began to disperse. Dale closed his notebook, exhausted. He felt like he'd been in a battle.

"We should leave," Ruth said quietly. "Before—"

But it was too late. Elijah was moving through the crowd, shaking hands, blessing people. And he was coming toward them.

Dale felt a spike of adrenaline. The man's presence was overwhelming up close—taller than Dale expected, those blue eyes sharp and assessing despite the beatific smile.

Elijah's gaze swept over their group and locked onto Kimmy.

He moved directly to her, knelt to her level.

"Hello, child. I don't believe we've met."

Kimmy stared at him, wide-eyed. "No, sir."

"What's your name?"

"Kimmy."

"Kimmy." Elijah took her hand. "You've been traveling far, haven't you? Looking for home."

Kimmy's eyes filled with tears. "How—how did you know?"

Dale tensed. Cold reading. Classic technique. Look at her clothes, her age, her body language. Say it with confidence and the target fills in the details.

But Kimmy didn't know that. She heard someone who saw her, understood her.

"God shows me things," Elijah said simply. "He tells me who needs His love most. And you, sweet child, you need so much love. You've been hurt. The people who should have protected you failed you. But you don't have to run anymore."

Kimmy was crying now. "I don't?"

"No." Elijah's voice was infinitely kind. "You can stay here. You can be part of our family. The family of God never abandons its children. We take care of each other. Forever."

Dale felt Ruth tense beside him. This was the moment—Elijah recruiting vulnerable people, promising belonging, drawing them in.

Ruth stepped forward, put a hand on Kimmy's shoulder. Her voice was polite but firm. "Thank you, Preacher Caine. We appreciate your words. But Kimmy is with us."

Elijah looked up at Ruth for the first time. His smile didn't waver, but something flickered in his eyes. Assessment. Calculation.

"Of course," he said smoothly, standing. "Family is sacred. I'm glad she has you." He looked at Kimmy again. "But if you need anything, child, you come find me. Our evening service is at seven. Special blessings for newcomers. I'd love to see you there."

"Thank you," Kimmy whispered.

Elijah's gaze swept over the group one more time—lingering on Dale, then Shauna, finally Levon. Dale saw him categorize them. Skeptics. Threats. Problems.

Then Elijah moved on, greeting other congregants, his attention already elsewhere.

Ruth steered Kimmy toward the exit. Dale grabbed his briefcase and followed. Shauna and Levon flanked them protectively.

They emerged into brutal sunlight. Dale's shirt was soaked with sweat.

"That was—" he started, then stopped.

"Dangerous," Ruth finished.

"He knew about me," Kimmy said. "Things he couldn't know."

"He guessed," Shauna said firmly. "It's manipulation, not revelation."

But Kimmy's expression said she didn't believe that. And Dale, despite all his training, wasn't entirely sure either.

Elijah Caine was very good at what he did.

And what he did was make people believe.

They walked back to the motel in silence, each processing what they'd witnessed. Dale kept seeing Elijah's eyes—those piercing blue eyes that seemed to look straight through you. And that smile. Warm and welcoming and somehow utterly empty.

Behind them, the revival tent rippled in the wind, white canvas glowing in the sun. From inside, the singing had started again.

Dale thought about Jim Jones. David Koresh. Heaven's Gate.

He thought about 144,000 souls.

And he wondered how much time they had before Elijah Caine did something terrible.
