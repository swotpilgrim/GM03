# Chapter 21: Elijah's Flight

Ruth stood outside the revival tent watching order slowly emerge from chaos.

The sheriff's car had arrived first—lights flashing, radio crackling. Then state police, then ambulances, then more police. The compound transformed from Elijah's domain into a crime scene in minutes.

She'd called them. Finally, they'd come.

Sheriff Hayes was a heavyset man in his fifties, face creased with confusion and horror. He'd been attending Elijah's services—Ruth had seen him in the congregation, nodding along with the sermons. Now he stood taking statements, his certainty shattered.

"You're telling me twenty people were imprisoned under that stage?" Hayes asked for the third time.

"Yes." Ruth handed him the evidence folder—thick with documentation, photographs, medical tests. "Everything's in here. Timeline, victims, evidence of drugging, Elijah's written plans for mass suicide. It's all documented."

Hayes flipped through the folder, his face going paler. "Jesus Christ. I've been... I drank that communion wine. Weeks of it."

"You were drugged too," Ruth said quietly. "That's why you didn't see it. That's why the whole town didn't see it. He was good at what he did."

"Where's Caine now?"

Ruth turned to look at the main tent. Through the open flaps, she could see the stage—empty except for the spilled wine pooling dark across the wood. "Last I saw, he was in there. But that was fifteen minutes ago during the chaos."

"I need to talk to him."

"Sheriff—" Ruth started, but Hayes was already walking toward the tent, one hand on his sidearm.

Ruth followed.

Inside, the tent was eerily quiet. The chairs sat empty in neat rows, as if waiting for the congregation to return. The stage lights still glowed. And on the stage, alone in the center, stood Elijah Caine.

He wasn't moving. Just standing there in his sweat-stained white suit, staring at the empty space to his left.

"...didn't tell me," he was saying. "You said they would believe. You said they would follow. You promised..."

Ruth's stomach turned. He was talking to nothing. Arguing with air.

Sheriff Hayes climbed onto the stage. "Elijah Caine, I'm placing you under—"

"IT lied to me." Elijah didn't look at Hayes. His eyes stayed fixed on the empty space. "Everything IT said was a lie. The ascension. The souls. The glory. All lies."

"Elijah—"

"I see IT now. Finally. What IT really is." Elijah's voice dropped to a whisper. "Not an angel. Never was. Something else. Something patient. Something that feeds on..."

He trailed off, and his face went white.

Ruth stepped closer. "Elijah, there's no one there. You're experiencing—"

"IT'S RIGHT THERE!" Elijah screamed, pointing at the empty air. "How can you not see IT? How can you—" He backed away from the invisible presence, stumbling. "No. No, I won't. I won't listen anymore. You can't make me—"

Dale appeared at the stage's edge, breathing hard like he'd run. "Ruth, let me try."

She nodded.

Dale climbed onto the stage slowly, hands visible, non-threatening. "Elijah. My name is Dale Freeman. I challenged you earlier. Do you remember?"

Elijah's eyes flickered toward Dale for a moment, then back to the empty space. "The seminary boy. The one who destroyed everything."

"I'm sorry it had to happen that way," Dale said gently. "But people would have died. You understand that, right? The wine was poison. If they'd drunk it—"

"They would have ascended." But Elijah's voice cracked. "They would have... or they would have just... died. Just died. And IT would have been satisfied."

He looked at Dale directly for the first time. His blue eyes were bloodshot, face haggard. "I thought IT was God. Four years. Visions, voices, signs. I thought I was chosen."

"You're ill," Dale said. "What you're experiencing is real to you, but it's a product of mental illness. Schizophrenia, most likely. With treatment—medication, therapy—the voices can stop. The visions can end."

"Can they?" Elijah looked back at the empty space. "Or will IT always be there?"

"There's no 'it,'" Dale said firmly. "I promise you. There's nothing there."

For a long moment, Elijah stood still. The tent was silent except for the generator hum outside and the distant sound of ambulance radios.

Then Elijah started laughing.

It was a terrible sound—broken, bitter, edged with hysteria. "Nothing there. Nothing. Four years of visions. Twenty people in a bunker. Four hundred people nearly poisoned. All for nothing. All because my brain is broken."

"Elijah—" Dale took a step forward.

But Elijah was already moving. He shoved past Dale, past Sheriff Hayes, jumped off the stage with more agility than his age suggested. Ruth tried to grab him, but he was faster.

"Elijah, stop!" Hayes shouted.

Elijah ran.

Out of the tent, into the night, white suit flashing in the floodlights. He sprinted toward the parking area where his gold Cadillac Eldorado sat gleaming.

Hayes ran after him. "Someone stop that man!"

But the state police were occupied with prisoners and families, and Elijah had a head start. He reached the Cadillac, fumbled with keys, got the door open.

The engine roared to life—big V8, pure American power.

Ruth reached the parking area just as the Cadillac reversed hard, spraying gravel. Elijah's face was visible through the windshield—not looking back, but at his passenger seat. Talking to it. Arguing with it.

The Cadillac spun, tires screaming, and accelerated toward the compound exit.

Hayes jumped into his sheriff's car, but by the time he got moving, Elijah was gone—taillights disappearing down the dark highway.

"Highway patrol," Hayes barked into his radio. "Pursuit of suspect, gold '77 Cadillac Eldorado, heading east on Highway 79. Suspect is Elijah Caine, wanted for false imprisonment, attempted murder, and about a dozen other charges. Consider him mentally unstable and dangerous."

The radio crackled acknowledgment. "Units responding. We'll set up roadblocks."

Ruth stood in the dirt watching the dark highway where Elijah had vanished. She felt simultaneously relieved and disturbed. Relieved he was gone—couldn't hurt anyone else tonight. Disturbed by his last words, his last look, his conversation with empty air.

Dale approached, hands shaking. "I almost had him calm."

"It's not your fault."

"I should have—"

"Dale." Ruth gripped his shoulder. "You stopped him from killing four hundred people tonight. Including himself. That's enough. More than enough."

Kimmy appeared, hugging herself despite the warmth. "Is it over?"

Ruth looked around. Prisoners being loaded into ambulances. Families crying and reuniting. The cult's infrastructure dismantled by police efficiency. The revival tent dark and empty.

"Yeah," Ruth said. "It's over."

But even as she said it, she remembered Elijah's face when he'd looked at that empty space. The absolute terror in his eyes.

IT lied to me, he'd said. I see what IT really is.

Had he seen something? Or just his own madness reflected back?

Ruth didn't know. And that uncertainty gnawed at her.

---

They gave statements. All five of them, separately and together, to state police detectives who recorded everything and took the evidence folder with something like awe.

"This is the most well-documented intervention I've ever seen," one detective said. "Medical tests, photographs, journal excerpts, witness interviews. You did our job for us."

"We did what was necessary," Ruth said.

"You saved lives." The detective closed his notebook. "Four hundred people would be dead tonight if you hadn't acted. I want you to understand that. You're heroes."

Ruth didn't feel like a hero. She felt exhausted.

They were standing outside the compound—two AM now, the chaos winding down—when Hayes's radio crackled.

"Sheriff Hayes, this is Highway Patrol Unit 12. We've found the Cadillac."

Hayes grabbed his radio. "Where?"

"Fifteen miles east, mile marker 47. Vehicle left the road at high speed, struck a telephone pole, caught fire. We've got one fatality."

Silence.

"Confirmed identity?" Hayes asked.

"Dental records pending, but vehicle registration matches Elijah Caine. Gold '77 Eldorado. Fire was intense—body's badly burned. But it's him. Had to be."

Ruth felt something cold settle in her chest. Dead. Elijah was dead.

Hayes looked at her. "You needed to know."

"Yeah." Ruth stared at the dark highway. "How... how did he crash?"

Hayes keyed the radio again. "Unit 12, was there evidence of mechanical failure?"

"Negative. Road was clear, visibility good. Skid marks indicate he was swerving erratically, like avoiding something in the road. But the road was empty. No obstacles, no animals, nothing."

Ruth's blood chilled.

Dale had heard too. He stepped closer. "He was seeing something."

"He was hallucinating," Shauna said firmly. She'd joined them, still in her bloodstained shirt. "Mental illness. He probably saw something that wasn't there and swerved."

"Or he saw IT," Kimmy whispered.

"There is no 'it,'" Shauna snapped. But her voice lacked conviction.

Ruth stared into the darkness. Somewhere out there, on a lonely stretch of Texas highway, Elijah Caine had died alone—fleeing or chasing something only he could see.

The rational explanation was simple: mental illness, hallucination, tragic end to a delusional man.

But Ruth remembered his face when he'd said, "I see what IT really is."

He'd been terrified.

Not of death. Not of capture. Not even of his own madness.

He'd been terrified of something else entirely.

"We should go," Ruth said quietly. "There's nothing more we can do here."

They walked back to the motel in silence, five people bound by what they'd witnessed and what they'd done.

And behind them, the revival tent glowed white in the darkness—empty now, harmless now, but still somehow wrong.

Ruth didn't look back.

She didn't want to see if something was watching from the shadows.
