# Chapter 1: Breakdown at the Crossroads

The Greyhound Scenicruiser shuddered once, twice, then gave up entirely. Ruth Morrison felt the transmission die beneath her feet—a grinding metallic surrender that turned the bus into a coasting hunk of chrome and prayer. The driver swore under his breath, muscled the wheel toward the shoulder, and brought them to rest at a crossroads so desolate it looked like God had forgotten to finish it.

"Folks, I got bad news." The driver stood, mopping sweat from his neck with a red handkerchief. "Transmission's shot. I radioed dispatch. Parts won't get here for three days, maybe four."

Ruth closed her eyes behind her wire-rim glasses and counted to five. Three days. In the middle of nowhere Texas, with nothing but her satchel and a teaching contract waiting in El Paso. She opened her eyes and looked out the window.

Five blocks of sun-bleached buildings. A truck stop diner with chrome siding. Closed storefronts. And dominating the horizon—an enormous white revival tent, canvas sides rippling in the hot wind.

"There's a town," the driver said, gesturing vaguely. "Y'all can wait there. Motel, diner, the works."

Ruth gathered her things and stood, pulling her cotton dress away from the vinyl seat. It stuck with sweat. Around her, the other four passengers stirred reluctantly—the only people still on the bus after six hours from Dallas.

She stepped down into heat that hit like a physical blow. One hundred and five degrees, easy. Dust coated everything—the pavement, the scrub brush, the sign that read CROSSROADS, POP. 800.

The others descended behind her. First came the nervous young man who'd spent the whole ride reading theology books. Wire-rim glasses, receding dark hair, button-down shirt sweated through. He blinked at the town like it might bite.

Then the redheaded woman in jeans and a tank top, athletic and compact, large purse clutched to her chest. She surveyed the surroundings with a nurse's clinical assessment.

The older man with the buzzed hair and prison-yard posture came next, moving carefully, eyes tracking everything. His denim jacket was too heavy for this heat, but he wore it anyway.

Last was the girl. Seventeen, maybe eighteen. Long dark hair in a braid, canvas sneakers held together with duct tape, arms covered despite the temperature. She'd cried quietly somewhere around Waco.

The five of them stood in the bus's shadow, strangers bound by mechanical failure.

"Well." Ruth adjusted her glasses and tried for a smile. "Let's find that motel."

Nobody moved.

The man with the buzz cut—Levon, she'd heard the driver call him during a bathroom stop—surveyed the town with naked suspicion. "This place looks dead."

"It's early afternoon," Ruth said. "Maybe people are—"

"At the revival," the girl interrupted softly, staring at the massive tent. "That's where everyone is."

They all looked at the tent. It sat at the edge of town like something from a different century, canvas sides glowing white in the brutal sun. Ruth could see the peak from here, crowned with a wooden cross.

"I need coffee," the redhead said flatly, already walking toward the diner. "And a phone that works."

Ruth followed, and the others trailed after. What else could they do?

The truck stop diner was pure 1980 Americana—chrome exterior, red vinyl booths visible through the windows, a Rexall pharmacy attached to one side. A payphone stood outside, receiver dangling on its cord.

Inside, the air conditioning barely made a dent. A box fan rattled in the corner. The place was empty except for a waitress behind the counter—fifty-something, bleached hair, tired eyes that brightened when they entered.

"Well, look at this! Visitors!" She grabbed menus, gestured to a large booth. "Y'all from the bus? Heard it broke down. Sit, sit."

They arranged themselves awkwardly. Ruth slid in first, then the theology student. The redhead took the opposite bench with the girl. Levon remained standing, eyeing the exit.

"Coffee?" the waitress asked.

"Please," Ruth said. "For everyone?"

Nods around the table. Levon finally sat, perched on the edge like he might bolt.

The waitress returned with a pot and five mugs. Ruth wrapped her hands around the cup even though it was ninety degrees inside.

"Y'all need rooms, there's a motel two blocks east." The waitress smiled. "Not much else to do around here, but we got the revival. Preacher Elijah Caine's been here two weeks now. Does miracles, real ones. My arthritis? Gone. Laid hands on me and I felt the power of God flow right through."

Ruth and the redhead exchanged glances.

"Where is everyone?" Ruth asked carefully. "The town seems... quiet."

"At the revival, most like. Services run morning and evening, all day Sunday. Whole town turns out." The waitress topped off cups that didn't need it. "Y'all should go. Preacher Caine sees into your soul. Knows things he couldn't possibly know. It's a blessing, having him here."

"Right," Levon muttered into his coffee. "A blessing."

The waitress didn't seem to hear the sarcasm. She drifted toward the kitchen, humming something that might have been a hymn.

Ruth pulled a spiral notebook from her satchel and clicked her pen. She wrote: *Crossroads, TX. June 1, 1980. Bus broken, 3-4 day delay. Town population 800, all at revival tent. Waitress mentions preacher Elijah Caine, miracles, healing.*

"You always take notes?" Levon asked.

"I'm a teacher. It helps me think." Ruth looked around the table. "We should introduce ourselves properly. I'm Ruth Morrison. Elementary school teacher, was headed to El Paso for a new job. Now I'm here."

"Dale Freeman." The theology student offered a nervous smile. "Was going to visit my sister in Arizona. I work at a bookstore in Dallas."

"Shauna Kelly." The redhead's voice was flat, professional. "ER nurse from Houston. Visiting family in New Mexico."

They all looked at Levon. He stared into his coffee for a long moment.

"Levon Ritter. Headed to Dallas." He didn't offer more.

The girl hunched her shoulders. "Kimmy. Just... Kimmy."

An uncomfortable silence settled. Ruth wrote their names in her notebook, something to do with her hands.

"So," Dale said, too brightly. "Three days here. That's... that'll be fine. Right?"

Through the window, the revival tent rippled in the wind. From somewhere distant came the sound of singing—hundreds of voices raised in unison.

"Motel first," Ruth said decisively. Someone had to organize this. "Then we figure out how to spend three days in a town with apparently one attraction."

"I ain't going to any revival," Levon said.

"Me neither," Shauna agreed.

Kimmy said nothing, but her eyes stayed on the tent.

They paid for coffee—Ruth insisted on covering it—and walked the two blocks to the motel. Main Street was deserted. Shops closed, windows dark. The First Baptist Church sat on a corner, white paint peeling, no cars in the lot.

The motel was called the Crossroads Motor Inn, single-story, turquoise doors facing a parking lot. The office smelled like Pine-Sol and cigarettes. The clerk—elderly, rheumy eyes, fingers yellow from smoking—barely looked up.

"Need rooms?"

"Five, please," Ruth said. "For three nights."

"Got plenty. Fifteen dollars a night, each."

Ruth did the math. Forty-five dollars. She could manage. "I'll take one."

The others murmured agreement and paid. The clerk handed over keys on diamond-shaped plastic tags.

"Y'all here for the revival?" he asked.

"Bus broke down," Shauna said shortly.

"Ahh. Well, you're here now. Might as well witness the glory. Preacher Caine's doing the Lord's work." The clerk's expression went distant, dreamy. "Changed my life, he did. I was lost. Now I'm found."

Same tone as the waitress. Same dreamy quality. Ruth noticed Shauna noticing too.

They took their keys and dispersed to rooms. Ruth's was number seven—double bed with a faded floral bedspread, wood paneling, window-unit air conditioner that clunked and wheezed. She went to the window.

The revival tent was visible from here. White canvas glowing in the afternoon sun. She could hear the singing clearly now—hymns she recognized from childhood in Oklahoma. Fervent. Certain.

Ruth pulled her notebook out again and added: *Everyone mentions Preacher Caine. Healing claims. Entire town attending services. Clerk and waitress both exhibit strange affect—distant, dreamy. Everyone here is at that tent.*

She looked at the clock. Three-fifteen. Three days here, waiting. In a town hypnotized by a revival preacher.

Through the thin walls, she heard movement. Dale unpacking books. Water running. The girl—Kimmy—was in the room on Ruth's other side, staring at the tent.

This was going to be a long three days.

Ruth changed into a fresh dress, splashed water on her face, and tried to make a plan. That's what she did—organized chaos, maintained control. Except she had no control here. Just a broken bus and four strangers and a town that felt wrong.

She picked up her room key and stepped outside. The heat was somehow worse than before, the sun relentless. Across the parking lot, she saw Levon leaning against his door, smoking a cigarette, watching the horizon. Shauna emerged from her room carrying her large purse, headed somewhere purposeful.

Dale's door opened and he stepped out, saw Ruth, offered that nervous smile again.

"This is strange, right?" he said. "The whole town at a revival. That's not normal."

"I don't know what normal is in West Texas," Ruth said. But she agreed. Something felt off. The empty streets. The dreamy waitress and clerk. The tent dominating everything.

Kimmy's door opened. The girl looked small in the doorway, uncertain.

"Can I—" She stopped, started again. "Is anyone going to the revival? I'd like to see it. Just see."

Ruth and Dale exchanged glances.

"Maybe tomorrow," Ruth said gently. "Let's settle in first."

Kimmy nodded, disappointed, and retreated into her room.

"She's young," Dale said quietly. "Younger than she's pretending to be."

"Running from something," Ruth agreed. She'd taught long enough to recognize fear in a child's eyes. "We should keep an eye on her."

"We?"

Ruth realized what she'd said. We. As if these strangers were her responsibility. But someone had to. She'd learned that early—if you don't organize the chaos, the chaos wins.

"Three days," she said. "We help each other get through three days. Then we're gone."

Dale nodded slowly. "Three days. Right."

But looking at the revival tent shimmering in the heat, listening to those distant voices singing about salvation and glory, Ruth felt a cold certainty in her chest.

Three days might be longer than any of them expected.
