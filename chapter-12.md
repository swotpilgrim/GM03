# Chapter 12: Inside the Prayer Tent

10 PM. The evening revival service was in full swing.

Levon crouched in darkness fifty yards behind the prayer tent, Dale and Shauna beside him. Inside the main tent, Elijah's voice carried across the night—preaching about tribulation, about ascension, about the chosen few.

Five hundred people listening, entranced.

Perfect cover.

"Ready?" Levon whispered.

Dale clutched his camera and notebook. "Ready."

Shauna had her medical kit. "Go."

They moved.

Levon led them through shadows, using equipment sheds and supply trailers for concealment. Security was minimal—Elijah relied on faith and isolation more than guards. Two men stood near the main tent entrance, but their attention was on the service, not the perimeter.

Sloppy. Levon would have posted spotters.

They reached the prayer tent. Small canvas structure behind the main stage, padlocked entrance. Levon pulled out his lockpick set—leather case with slim metal tools. He'd practiced this specific lock for two hours this afternoon.

Ninety seconds. That's all he needed.

He worked by feel, tension wrench applying pressure while the pick manipulated pins. First pin set. Second. Third. The lock was cheap, three-pin tumbler, designed to keep out casual intruders, not professionals.

Click.

Sixty seconds.

The padlock opened. Levon pocketed it, lifted the tent flap. Inside, darkness. He pulled out his flashlight—red filter to preserve night vision—and swept the interior.

Empty space. Dirt floor. And in the center, stairs descending into darkness.

Steel steps, industrial construction. At the bottom, twenty feet down, a steel hatch.

"Jesus," Dale whispered.

"Down," Levon said.

They descended single file. Levon first, flashlight leading. The stairs were solid, no creaking. Good construction, military grade. At the bottom, the steel hatch sat slightly ajar.

Unlocked.

Levon paused, listening. Nothing. He gripped the hatch handle, pulled.

Heavy hinges groaned softly. Beyond, more stairs leading deeper.

And lights. Dim battery-powered lanterns.

Someone was down here. Or had been recently.

Levon's pulse hammered. This was the moment—commit or retreat. Once they went through that hatch, they were inside Elijah's secret. No excuse if caught.

He thought about Ruth and Kimmy topside, sitting in the service, ready to create distractions if needed. About the seven missing people—maybe more—imprisoned somewhere in this bunker.

He descended.

The second stairway ended in a large chamber. Cold War fallout shelter, exactly as Levon had suspected. Concrete walls reinforced with steel beams. Battery lanterns hung from hooks, casting dim yellow light. The air smelled stale—recycled, ventilated, but enclosed.

And cots. Twenty cots lined against the walls.

Twenty people lying motionless.

"Oh god," Dale breathed.

Shauna moved immediately, her nurse training taking over. She crossed to the nearest cot—young man, maybe twenty-five. She checked his pulse.

"Alive. Sedated. IV in his arm." She examined the IV bag. "Saline and sedatives. Keeping them unconscious."

Levon swept his flashlight across the chamber. Every cot occupied. Twenty people—men and women, young and old—lying unconscious with IVs in their arms. Their faces were peaceful, dreaming. They had no idea where they were.

"More than seven," Dale said, voice shaking. "He said seven were missing. There's twenty here."

Levon's stomach turned. How long had Elijah been doing this? How many people had the town lost without noticing?

Then he saw the walls.

Biblical writing covered every surface. Hand-written in what looked like marker or paint. Verses from Revelation. Quotes about the 144,000. Diagrams of heaven and hell. Symbols Levon didn't recognize—crosses mixed with other shapes, geometric patterns, occult imagery.

And in the center of the far wall, written in red: **ASCENSION CEREMONY: 4 DAYS**

Shauna saw it too. "Four days. What happens in four days?"

Levon photographed everything. The cots. The prisoners. The IVs. The walls. Every angle, every detail. Click, click, click. Evidence they couldn't ignore.

Dale found a desk in the corner—makeshift workspace with papers, notebooks, supplies. He rifled through them, hands shaking.

"Oh no. Oh god, no."

"What?" Levon asked.

Dale held up a document. Typed pages, organized, detailed.

**FINAL ASCENSION PROTOCOL**

Levon read over his shoulder.

It was a procedure. Step-by-step instructions for mass suicide.

Step 1: Gather the faithful for final communion service. Target: 144 souls (124 from congregation + 20 prepared vessels from bunker).

Step 2: Administer communion wine laced with arsenic. Dosage calculations attached. Lethal within 30 minutes.

Step 3: Lead congregation in final prayers during onset of symptoms. Maintain calm. Ensure compliance.

Step 4: Ascension complete. 144 souls delivered to God. Tribulation survivors will find only empty vessels.

Levon's hands went cold.

"He's planning mass suicide," Dale whispered. "In four days. One hundred forty-four people."

Shauna crossed to them, read the document. Her face went pale. "The twenty down here—he calls them 'prepared vessels.' He's been drugging them for weeks, keeping them sedated. They're the sacrifice. The first to go."

"And the congregation thinks they're ascending to heaven," Levon said.

Dale flipped through more papers. Purchase receipts for arsenic from agricultural suppliers. Dosage calculations based on body weight. Timeline of preparation—how long to dissolve poison in wine, when to seal containers, when to serve.

Meticulous. Organized. The work of someone who'd been planning this for months.

"We have to get them out," Shauna said, looking at the twenty prisoners. "We can't leave them here. Four days—"

"We can't move them now," Levon said. It killed him to say it, but it was true. "We don't have transport. We don't have medical support to handle twenty sedated people. And if Elijah notices they're gone before we get authorities involved, he could accelerate the timeline."

"So we just leave them?" Shauna's voice cracked.

"We document everything. Get this evidence to authorities tonight. They raid the bunker, arrest Elijah, save everyone." Levon photographed the planning documents. "But we need to move. We've been down here ten minutes already."

Dale gathered papers—the suicide protocol, purchase receipts, dosage calculations. "Evidence. We take it all."

Levon photographed the countdown calendar. Four days. Ninety-six hours. Then Elijah would poison 144 people and call it salvation.

A sound above froze them.

Footsteps.

Someone was coming.

"Hide," Levon hissed.

They dove behind supply shelves along the back wall—stacked crates of bottled water, canned food, medical supplies. Levon killed his flashlight. Dale clutched the documents to his chest. Shauna's breathing was rapid, panicked.

The hatch opened above. Footsteps on the stairs.

A woman descended—middle-aged, plain dress. One of Elijah's inner circle. She carried a tray of supplies.

Levon watched through a gap between crates. The woman moved to the first cot, checked the young man's IV, adjusted the flow rate. She murmured prayers—something about preparing vessels, purifying souls.

She moved methodically down the line. Checking IVs. Adjusting doses. Praying over each prisoner.

Levon's leg cramped. He fought not to move. Dale's breathing was too loud. Shauna had her hand over her mouth.

The woman reached the tenth cot. Halfway through.

A walkie-talkie crackled on her belt.

"Sister Margaret, return to service. Brother Caine needs assistance with communion."

"Coming," she said into the walkie-talkie.

She finished checking the current IV quickly, then turned toward the stairs. Climbed them. The hatch closed.

They waited. Sixty seconds. Ninety.

"Go," Levon whispered.

They emerged from hiding. Levon's legs were shaking. He'd done plenty of dangerous jobs—robbery, theft, breaking and entering. But those had been for money. This was life and death.

Dale had the documents. Shauna took final photos of the prisoners. Levon photographed the medical supplies—IV bags labeled with pharmaceutical names he'd have to look up later.

"We have enough," Levon said. "We need to leave."

They climbed the stairs. Through the hatch. Up the second stairway to the prayer tent. Levon paused at the tent entrance, listening.

The service continued. Singing now. Hymns echoing across the field.

"Clear," Levon whispered.

They slipped out, and he replaced the padlock. Locked it exactly as they'd found it. No evidence of intrusion.

They moved through darkness, back to the equipment shed, then along the perimeter to the road. Forty yards. Sixty. One hundred.

They reached the edge of the compound. Safety.

Levon finally breathed.

"Keep walking. Act normal. Like we're heading back from a walk."

They walked down the dark road toward town. Away from the tent. Away from Elijah's voice preaching about salvation.

Away from twenty people sedated and waiting to die in four days.

At the motel, Ruth and Kimmy were waiting in Ruth's room. They looked up as the door opened.

"Did you—" Ruth started.

"Twenty people," Levon said. "All sedated. IVs keeping them unconscious."

Ruth went pale. "Twenty?"

Dale spread the stolen documents on the bed. "He's planning mass suicide. Four days from now. Final communion service. Arsenic-laced wine. One hundred forty-four people."

Ruth read the protocol. Her hands shook. "He's going to poison them. All of them."

Shauna nodded. "The twenty in the bunker are what he calls 'prepared vessels.' They go first. Then the congregation—he's targeting one hundred twenty-four people from the services. Total of one hundred forty-four."

"His number," Dale said quietly. "The 144,000 from Revelation. He thinks delivering 144 souls is his divine mission."

Kimmy looked at the photos Levon had spread out. Twenty unconscious people on cots. Walls covered in biblical madness. Countdown calendar in red.

"We have to stop him," she said.

"We will," Ruth said. Her teacher voice, firm and certain. "We have evidence. We go to authorities tonight. State police, FBI if we have to. They'll raid the bunker, arrest Elijah, save everyone."

Levon organized the photos and documents. Purchase receipts. Dosage calculations. Suicide protocol. Photos of imprisoned people. Medical evidence of drugging.

Airtight case.

"We need to move fast," he said. "That inner circle woman—Sister Margaret—she'll report back to Elijah. If he suspects anything, he could accelerate the timeline."

"How far is the nearest state police barracks?" Shauna asked.

"Forty miles," Ruth said. "I checked. But we can't drive—our bus is still being fixed."

"We call them," Dale said. "Payphone at the truck stop. Call state police, tell them everything, demand immediate response."

"Will they believe us?" Kimmy asked.

Ruth looked at the evidence spread across the bed. "They have to."

Levon felt the weight of the photos in his hands. Twenty people sedated. Four days until mass death. One hundred forty-four souls Elijah planned to "ascend."

They'd broken into the bunker, stolen evidence, escaped without detection.

Now they had to convince authorities to act before Elijah poisoned everyone.

Four days.

Ninety-six hours.

The clock was ticking.
